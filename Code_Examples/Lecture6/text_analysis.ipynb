Despite his relatively undistinguished background and\\never-recurrent ill health, he rose rapidly to prominence at Rome, pursuing the double career in\\nthe courts and political life for which he had been trained. He began also quickly to acquire\\ncelebrity as an author of tragedies and of polished essays, moral, literary and scientific.\\nSentenced to death by successive emperors (Caligula in A.D. 37 and Claudius in A.D. 41), he\\nspent eight years in exile on the island of Corsica, allegedly for an affair with Caligula‟s sister.\\nRecalled in A.D. 49, he was made praetor, and was appointed tutor to the boy who was to\\nbecome, in A.D. 54, the emperor Nero. On Nero‟s succession Seneca acted for some eight years\\nas an unofficial chief minister. The early part of this reign was remembered as a period of sound\\nimperial government, for which, according to our sources, the main credit must be given to\\nSeneca. His control over an increasingly cruel emperor declined as enemies turned Nero against\\nhim with representations that his popularity made him a danger, or with accusations of\\nimmorality or excessive wealth ill assorting with the noble Stoic principles he professed. Retiring\\nfrom public life he devoted his last three years to philosophy and writing, particularly the Letters\\nfrom a Stoic. In A.D. 65, following the discovery of a plot against the emperor, which might\\nhave resulted in Seneca‟s elevation to the throne, he and many others were compelled by Nero to\\ncommit suicide. His fame as an essayist and dramatist lasted until two or three centuries ago\\nwhen, unaccountably, he passed into literary oblivion.\\nROBIN CAMPBELL lives in Islington, London. An exiled Scot, now a barrister, he\\ndecided that Seneca was overdue for discovery while at Wadham College, Oxford, where he was\\nan Open Classical Scholar and gained a First in Honour Mods. He served in Kenya and Uganda\\nwith African troops as a subaltern in a Highland Regiment, and after a year at Cambridge\\nlearning another African language (Chinyanja), he returned to Africa for three years as a District\\nOfficer. This was followed after Zambia‟s independence by a year as a Magistrate, trying\\nwitch-doctors, hearing appeals from tribal courts over a vast area and revising this translation at\\nintervals of leisure in the bush. His practice at the bar in Gray‟s Inn tends to be concerned with\\naction by local authorities.

He also studied the\\ngeography and ethnology of Egypt and India6 and developed a lasting interest in natural science,\\nspeculative rather than empirical (although Pliny speaks of him as an authority on geology,\\nmarine life and meteorology, and others have admired his remarks on, for example, evolution or\\nthe explanation of rings round the sun). His interest was drawn at an early age to Pythagorean\\nmysticism and various cults of eastern origin then gaining adherents in Rome, before his final\\nacceptance, in large part, of the Stoic philosophy.\\nAfter training for the bar he took successfully to public life, becoming quaestor in spite of\\nthe handicaps of his health, his foreign background and comparative lack of family or other\\nconnexions. When Caligula succeeded Tiberius in A.D. 37, Seneca had become a leading\\nspeaker in the Senate, and so aroused the jealousy7 of the new emperor that according to Dio\\nCassius he ordered his execution and was only induced to let him off by a woman close to the\\nimperial throne who said that Seneca was „suffering from advanced tuberculosis and it would not\\nbe long before he died‟.8 This incident apparently resulted in his temporary retirement from\\npolitical affairs.\\nIn A.D. 41, in the first year of the reign of Caligula‟s successor, Claudius, Seneca again\\ncame under sentence of death – commuted to banishment – for reasons which we do not know.\\nThe pretext was adultery with Julia Livilla, the late emperor‟s sister; the more likely explanation9\\nis that the new ruler‟s consort, the notorious Messalina, considered him dangerous. His exile on\\nthe island of Corsica does not seem to have been endured as stoically as it might have been. The\\nencouraging spirit of an essay of consolation sent to his dearly loved mother Helvia is entirely\\nabsent in another addressed to Polybius, an ex-slave who had become a trusted servant of the\\nemperor, which contains some abject flattery and was probably never meant to be published. He\\nhad by now suffered the loss not only of his father but of a son, and his first wife died while he\\nwas away. The only solace for him in these eight long years of loneliness and near despair was\\nthe reception given to the poems, tragedies and essays to friends which he continued composing\\nduring his banishment.\\nHis fortunes turned dramatically in A.D. 49. Messalina had been executed and the\\nemperor‟s new wife, Agrippina, had Seneca recalled to Rome, appointed to the high office of\\npraetor and made tutor to her twelve-year-old son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (the boy who\\nwas shortly to become the emperor Nero). Agrippina‟s motives, according to Tacitus, apart from\\nthe instruction of her son, were a confidence that because of his „literary fame‟ the move would\\ngain them popularity, and a belief that he would prove a reliable ally and a useful adviser to\\nherself and Nero in their plans for future power.10\\nThere is no evidence that Seneca was connected with the poisoning of Claudius in A.D.\\n54. But he wrote the speeches which the seventeen-year-old Nero delivered after his accession,\\n\\n\\x0cand was probably the author of a witty, if to us a little tasteless, attack on the death ruler‟s\\nmemory (the Apocolocyntosis or „Pumpkinification‟, an imaginary tale of the rebuffs received by\\nthe recently deceased emperor when he presents himself at the portals of Heaven and his\\napplication for admission is debated by the Gods). Nero did make a formal speech in honour of\\nhis predecessor, which was said to display „a great deal of polish‟ and to be a good example of\\nSeneca‟s „attractive style, well tuned to the ears of his time‟.11\\nThe new regime opened well and „Nero‟s first five years‟ were later spoken of as a period\\nof unequalled good government, the emperor Trajan even calling them the finest period in the\\nhistory of imperial Rome.12 For this Rome was indebted to Seneca and an army officer named\\nBurrus. These two, „the most influential as well as the most enlightened of the men who\\nsurrounded Nero‟ (Dio),13 „whose wide experience was common knowledge‟ (Tacitus),14\\nprevented the hot-headed young man from carrying out a lot of murders on his accession and\\naimed at channelling some of his energies into „permissible pleasures‟.15 Only briefly alarmed by\\nthe poisoning of Britannicus and acting throughout in complete harmony they succeeded in\\nkeeping public business out of Agrippina‟s hands and in their own. Tacitus ascribes the secret of\\nthe influence of Seneca to „his tuition of Nero in public speaking, and his engaging manners and\\nhigh principles‟, that of Burrus to „his military responsibilities and austerity of character‟.16\\nThe two of them „took over total power, and exercised it, to the utmost of their ability, in\\nthe best and justest way conceivable, thus each alike arousing all men‟s approval‟ (Dio).17 While\\nNero amused himself they set about the problems of government; we notice – to give instances\\nof their activity – legal and financial reforms including the reduction of indirect taxation and\\nsteps to prevent peculation and extortion by provincial governors, and the prosecution of a\\nsuccessful war in Armenia to settle the empire‟s eastern frontier. Seneca‟s geographical interests\\nappear in the dispatch of an expedition „to investigate the source of the Nile‟. Yet another of his\\ninterests was shorthand, the Roman system of which he is said to have completely revised.\\nNeither he nor Burrus appears to have held any standing legal or constitutional office that\\ncould be said to give them the authority they wielded during these years. Seneca, „the real master\\nof the world‟,18 seems simply to have been the moving force behind the throne. It is probably\\nsafe to say that Nero (unlike Aristotle‟s celebrated pupil at a similar age, Alexander the Great)\\nwas still under the influence of a teacher of undoubted personal charm, and was quite content to\\nleave to him the direction of affairs in which he had little real interest. Once the young emperor\\nbegan to listen to other advisers and increasingly to indulge his more violent and vindictive\\nimpulses this happy situation was doomed.\\nIn A.D. 58 Seneca was being attacked by people like Publius Suillius Rufus.19\\nAccusations seem to have ranged in gravity from sleeping with the emperor‟s mother (obviously\\nthe man had failed to learn his lesson from his „thoroughly deserved‟ banishment for „seducing\\nimperial princesses‟) and the introduction of the emperor to paederasty, to the uselessness of his\\nstudies and the affectedness of his oratorical style. But the campaign against him generally\\ncentred on the apparent contrast – it has been a stock criticism of Seneca right down the centuries\\n– between his philosophical teachings and his practice. Instances of this hypocrisy, according to\\nSuillius, were the philosopher‟s denunciations of tyranny, which did not stop him from being\\ntutor to a tyrant; of flattery, ill according with the attitude he had adopted, especially from exile,\\ntowards ex-slaves who headed departments in Claudius‟ administration; of extravagance, in spite\\nof (allegedly) giving banquets served at five hundred identical tables of citrus wood with ivory\\nlegs; and, above all, of wealth. „What kind of wisdom,‟ asked Suillius, „what philosophical\\nteachings, had led him to acquire three hundred million sesterces within the space of four years\\n\\n\\x0cin royal favour? The childless and their legacies had been, if he might so put it, enticed into\\nSeneca‟s net, whilst all Italy and the provinces were being sucked dry by his practice of lending\\nmoney at unlimited rates of interest.‟\\nSeneca was indeed already celebrated for his riches. Juvenal mentions „the great Gardens\\nof the immensely wealthy Seneca‟.20 Agrippina, says Dio, had acquired for him „untold wealth\\nfrom all sources‟.21 The agricultural writer Columella mentions the remarkable productivity of\\nhis wine growing estates, the best in Italy, at Mentana.22 The reply, if any, which Seneca gave to\\nhis attackers‟ criticisms of his wealth, was probably that contained in an essay On the Happy Life\\nsent to his brother Gallio. What counts, he says, is one‟s attitude to wealth, which is the wise\\nman‟s servant and the fool‟s master; he, like any good Stoic, could lose all he had at any moment\\nwithout being a whit less happy. This is the core of a long reply to the charge, which he states\\nwith complete frankness, that „philosophers do not practise what they preach‟. His everyday life\\ndid not lend countenance to such attacks (we have at least his own accounts23 of his plain diet\\nand life-long teetotalism, his hard bed, cold baths and daily runs); and on this occasion he came\\nto no harm from his enemies.\\nIn A.D. 59 Nero had his mother put to death, the murder being carried out in cold blood\\nafter the calamitous failure of an attempt to stage an accident at sea. There is reason to believe\\nthat Seneca and Burrus had no knowledge of or part in the planning of this crime, but as the facts\\nbecame known did their best to lessen its impact on public opinion. Seneca certainly drafted the\\nletter sent to the Senate „explaining‟ how her death was the result of the exposure of a dangerous\\nplot of hers against the emperor‟s life. Dio would have us believe that Seneca averted a general\\nmassacre by saying to Nero, „However many people you slaughter you cannot kill your\\nsuccessor.‟24\\nTacitus25 tells us that the death („probably murder‟) of Burrus in A.D. 62 „broke Seneca‟s\\npower‟. Enemies gained the ear of Nero with tales of Seneca‟s popularity and growing wealth;\\nthe first was represented as being dangerous to the throne, the second as overshadowing the\\npossessions of the emperor himself (whose abilities as an artist and a speaker were also, it was\\nsaid, being disparaged by his old instructor). Nero, they said, was now grown up and it was time\\nfor him to „shake off his tutor‟. Seneca, warned of this by friends, realized his danger and\\ndecided to ask the emperor for permission to retire from public life. The request was granted and\\nthe parting was made amicable.\\nFor the last three years of his life, Seneca devoted himself to philosophy and writing,\\nincluding the Epistulae Morales to Lucilius Junior, a native of Pompeii, a hard-working higher\\ncivil servant (procurator in Sicily at the time) who appears to have dabbled in literature and\\nphilosophy. Spending his time moving around southern Italy with Paulina, his second wife,\\nSeneca now rarely visited Rome, and even, to disarm suspicion or for greater safety, gave (says\\nDio) his entire fortune to the emperor. Tacitus mentions a story of an attempt on his life by\\npoisoning, averted either because a slave gave the plot away or because the philosopher was, in\\nfear of just such an attack, living on „an extremely simple diet of fruits growing wild and running\\nwater‟.26\\nThen in A.D. 65 came the disastrous conspiracy against the emperor by Piso and others,\\nquite possibly including Seneca. There was a report of a sub-conspiracy to kill Piso as well and\\nmake Seneca emperor – „being a man who seemed to be marked out for supreme power by the\\ngood qualities for which he was so famous‟.27 Many people lost their lives on the discovery of\\nthe plot. Seneca, like many others, was asked to commit suicide, the then prevailing method of\\nimperial execution. Tacitus‟ description of his death is not quickly forgotten.28 His brothers and\\n\\n\\x0cLucan followed him, all by their own hands, in the course of Nero‟s frenzied purge of enemies\\nreal and imagined.\\nAccording to some, a true Stoic, like Cato under the Republic, would have stayed on in\\npolitical life to the bitter end. But after the loss of all his influence over Nero, the Spaniard could\\nhardly have hoped to be of useful service any longer to the Roman world, and (in an age in\\nwhich many lived in recurrent dread of a capricious emperor‟s message demanding, obliquely or\\notherwise, the recipient‟s suicide) the alternative to his retirement was undoubtedly death.\\nCertain other Stoics, indeed, stood up to emperors and were rewarded for their opposition to\\nmisrule with martyrdom. Seneca chose to spend what time was left to him in philosophy, and the\\nreader may be left to decide, in fairness not forgetting his chronic ill health, whether his „lack of\\nmoral courage outside the study‟ in this or earlier events detracts from his achievements.\\nSurprisingly, perhaps, the satirist of the century, Juvenal, does not pick on the difference between\\nthis public figure‟s conduct and his philosophical professions, of which a variety of later writers\\nhave made play.29 „Sir, are you so grossly ignorant of human nature,‟ asked Dr Johnson, „as not\\nto know that a man may be very sincere in good principles without having good practice?‟\\nSeneca, all the same, may well be history‟s most notable example of a man who failed to live up\\nto his principles.\\nThis does not prevent him from being the outstanding figure of his age. „Seneca, in those\\ndays unsurpassed both in the field of letters and in power (power which afterwards grew too\\ngreat and recoiled upon his own head), was the last man to be impressed by things which did not\\ncount,‟ said his contemporary Pliny.30 Money, power or achievements in public life or letters are\\n– despite the interest of the little we know of his career – not the things with which Seneca would\\nwant to be connected by people coming across his name today. That he did not expect to be\\nforgotten we know (in one letter he actually promises Lucilius immortality through having\\ncorresponded with him); but what he would have liked to be remembered for would have been\\nthe value of the ideas which, so he tells Lucilius in his eighth letter, he was committing to writing\\nin the hope that they might be „of use to later generations‟.\\n\\nSENECA AND PHILOSOPHY\\nStoicism, for centuries the most influential philosophy in the Graeco-Roman world, had a\\nlong history before Seneca. Founded by Zeno (born of Phoenician descent in Cyprus c. 336/5\\nB.C.) who had taught or lectured in a well-known stoa (a colonnade or porch) – hence the name\\n– in Athens, it had been developed and modified by a succession of thinkers whose opinions on\\nvarious logical, ethical or cosmological questions showed some fair divergencies. As a moral\\ncreed, however, it was based throughout on the following framework of belief.\\nThe Stoics saw the world as a single great community in which all men are brothers,\\nruled by a supreme providence which could be spoken of, almost according to choice or context,\\nunder a variety of names or descriptions including the divine reason, creative reason, nature, the\\nspirit or purpose of the universe, destiny, a personal god, even (by way of concession to\\ntraditional religion) „the gods‟. It is man‟s duty to live in conformity with the divine will, and\\nthis means, firstly, bringing his life into line with „nature‟s laws‟, and secondly, resigning\\nhimself completely and uncomplainingly to whatever fate may send him. Only by living thus,\\nand not setting too high a value on things which can at any moment be taken away from him, can\\nhe discover that true, unshakeable peace and contentment to which ambition, luxury and above\\nall avarice are among the greatest obstacles.\\nLiving „in accordance with nature‟ means not only questioning convention and training\\n\\n\\x0courselves to do without all except the necessities (plain food, water, basic clothing and shelter)\\nbut developing the inborn gift of reason which marks us off as different from the animal world.\\nWe are meant to set free or perfect this rational element, this particle of the universal reason, the\\n„divine spark‟ in our human make-up, so that it may campaign against and conquer pain, grief,\\nsuperstition and the fear of death. It will show us that „there‟s nothing either good or bad but\\nthinking makes it so‟, discipline the pleasures and the passions, and generally subordinate the\\nbody and emotions to the mind and soul.\\nIn this way we shall arrive at the true end of man, happiness, through having attained the\\none and only good thing in life, the ideal or goal called arete in Greek and in Latin virtus – for\\nwhich the English word „virtue‟ is so unsatisfactory a translation. This, the summum bonum or\\n„supreme ideal‟, is usually summarized in ancient philosophy as a combination of four qualities:\\nwisdom (or moral insight), courage, self-control and justice (or upright dealing). It enables a man\\nto be „self-sufficient‟, immune to suffering, superior to the wounds and upsets of life (often\\npersonalized as Fortuna, the goddess of fortune). Even a slave thus armed can be called „free‟, or\\nindeed titled „a king‟ since even a king cannot touch him. Another example of these „paradoxes‟\\nfor which the Stoics were celebrated is one directed at the vanity of worldly possessions: „the\\nshortest route to wealth is the contempt of wealth.‟31\\nThis ethic, together with its backing in a system of physics and logic, had first been given\\nshape in the minds of thinkers who, although Greek-speaking, were for the most part not of\\nEuropean descent, coming from places in Asia Minor or the Levant like Tarsus, Cyprus, and\\nBabylon. This does not seem to have reduced the appeal it made to educated Romans when,\\naround the middle of the second century B.C., it first came to their notice. The duties it\\ninculcated – courage and endurance, self-control and self-reliance, upright conduct and just\\ndealing, simple and unluxurious habits, rationality, obedience to the state – were self-evident to\\nmany Romans, corresponding quite closely to the traditional idea of virtus. The development of\\nthe jus naturae by the Roman jurists and Posidonius‟ identification of the Stoic world\\ncommunity or cosmopolis with the Roman Empire made its acceptance even easier. At a later\\ndate the Stoic view of the ruler (this term including governors, magistrates and administrative\\nofficials)32 as a man whose actions could be criticized, and even as a minister or servant, was to\\nbe disliked by emperors, some of whom replied by expelling „the philosophers‟. But Stoics were\\nusually far from hostile to monarchy as such, however openly they declared that rank counted for\\nnothing against the duty of all men, whatever their station, to play their part in life well.\\nDespite its wide acceptance in educated circles, early Stoicism had a forbidding aspect\\nwhich went far to explain its failure to influence the masses. There was something unreal or\\nfictional about the sapiens, the wise man or philosopher. This ideal figure seemed, from the way\\nthe Stoic lecturers talked, to have somehow become perfect in some sudden transformation long\\nago; gradual self-improvement was hardly discussed. The target it set seemed too high for\\nordinary men. It stifled and repressed ordinary human emotions in striving after apatheia,\\nimmunity to feeling; Cato, the great Stoic saint, is reported to have expressed regret at having\\nkissed his wife in a moment of danger. It held that in certain circumstances a man‟s self-respect\\nmight invite, as an act of supreme nobility, his suicide. In pursuing the ideal of autarkeia,\\nself-sufficiency, it seemed to make the perfect man a person detached and aloof from his fellows,\\nsuperior to the world he lived in. Altogether the impression it conveyed, for all its idealism and\\nsincerity, could be cold, dogmatic and unrealistic. Seneca‟s contribution to ancient philosophy\\nlay in the humanization of this creed, continuing a process begun long before in Rhodes and\\nRome by Panaetius and Posidonius.\\n\\n\\x0cAlthough Seneca wrote for a relatively narrow circle of educated persons (usually\\naddressing his compositions to a particular friend or relative as if he were that person‟s special\\nspiritual adviser) his letters and essays show a Stoicism more closely reconciled with the facts\\nand frailty of human nature. The ideal of apatheia is much modified. Self-sufficient though he is,\\nthe sapiens can now have friends and can grieve, within limits, at the loss of one. It has become\\nhis duty to be kind and forgiving towards others, indeed to „live for the other person‟.33 In his\\nway of living he should avoid being ostentatiously different from those he tries to win from\\nmoral ignorance. He has to battle like the rest against his failings, in a long and painful progress\\ntowards perfection in which all can do with help from above or the inspiration of others‟\\nexample. Seneca himself, we observe, occasionally makes immodest statements concerning his\\nown progress, but is capable of humility, as in one description of himself as „a long way from\\nbeing a tolerable, let alone a perfect human being‟.34\\nIn statements of man‟s kinship with a beneficent, even loving god and of a belief in\\nconscience as the divinely inspired „inner light of the spirit‟, his attitudes are religious beyond\\nanything in Roman state religion, in his day little more than a withered survival of formal\\nworship paid to a host of ancient gods and goddesses. Christian writers have not been slow to\\nrecognize the remarkably close parallels between isolated sentences in Seneca‟s writings and\\nverses of the Bible.35 On the other hand the word „God‟ or „the gods‟ was used by the\\nphilosophers more as a time-honoured and convenient expression than as standing for any\\nindispensable or even surely identifiable component of the Stoic system. And the tendency of\\nStoicism was always to exalt man‟s importance in the universe rather than to abase him before a\\nhigher authority. The hope of immortality was occasionally held out but Seneca does not play on\\nit. To him as to most Stoics virtue was to be looked on as its own reward and vice as its own\\npunishment. The religious hunger of the masses of his day was to be met not by philosophy but\\nby the cults of Isis and Mithras and Christianity.\\nFor the ancient world, then, apart from reviving philosophy in Latin literature, he\\n„spiritualized and humanized‟36 Stoicism. What of Seneca and modern philosophy? The latter, at\\nleast in the universities of the English-speaking world, has for some time been set on a course\\nwhich he would certainly have condemned; he would not have understood the attention it pays to\\nordinary language, and some of his letters (for example letter XLVIII) make it clear that it would\\nhave come in for a share of his impatience with philosophers (not excluding Stoics) who in his\\neyes degraded philosophy by wasting their time on verbal puzzles or logical hairsplitting. But\\nmore than this, he would have denounced the opinion to which most philosophers, tacitly or\\notherwise, have come round in the last half-century, that it is no part of the business of\\nphilosophy to turn people into better persons, as tantamount to desertion or lèse-majesté. His\\ntremendous faith in philosophy as a mistress was grounded on a belief that her end was the\\npractical one of curing souls, of bringing peace and order to the feverish minds of men pursuing\\nthe wrong aims in life. „What we say should be of use, not just entertaining.‟37 Even speculation\\non the nature or meaning of the universe was of secondary importance, something which the\\nphilosopher might or might not, as he chose, take up in leisure moments. A philosopher‟s words\\nshould (as a Quaker might put it) „speak to our condition‟. Fielding‟s observation that few people\\nin the position of being „overloaded with prosperity or adversity‟ could be too wise or too foolish\\nnot to gain from reading Seneca might have gratified him not merely as an indication that his\\nwritings were proving „of use‟ to later generations, but also as showing that a philosopher could\\nstill be regarded as someone to be turned to for advice or consolation. To Seneca, as Letter XC\\nand other letters plainly show, the philosopher and the wise man were the same person.\\n\\n\\x0cWhether or not his letters may still be turned to for their pointers to the contented life,\\nthey cannot be read without noticing how far in advance of their time are many of his ideas – on\\nthe shows in the arena, for example, or the treatment of slaves. His implicit belief in the equality\\nand brotherhood of man despite all barriers of race or class or rank, was one, resurrected from\\nthe days of the early Stoics, which led directly to great improvements in the legal position of\\nslaves; besides explaining the then remarkable attitude towards slaves expressed in Letter\\nXLVII, the belief was also the germ of the notion of natural law, the law which was thought to\\ntranscend national boundaries and form a basis for the validity of international law. These\\nelements of Stoicism made their not so small or indirect contribution to the French and American\\nrevolutions.\\n\\nSENECA AND LITERATURE\\nHis letters and other writings\\n\\n„Seneca,‟ Quintilian tells us, „turned his hand to practically everything which can be\\nmade the subject of study – speeches, poems, letters, dialogues all surviving.‟ Much of this is\\nlost, including all his speeches (political and forensic), a biography of his father, and essays or\\ntreatises on marriage, superstition and a variety of other subjects, mainly scientific.\\nThe works remaining to us (apart from brief poems or epigrams whose attribution to\\nSeneca is sometimes doubtful) are of two main kinds. There are, first, the philosophical letters\\nand essays, including treatises with such titles as The Happy Life, The Shortness of Life,\\nProvidence, Anger, Clemency, Problems in Natural Science and literary consolationes to persons\\nin bereavement. And secondly there are the tragedies, probably never staged and intended only\\nfor reading or recitation among a relatively small circle.38\\nThe one hundred and twenty four letters to Lucilius comprise something entirely new in\\nliterature. For in these, which were his most conspicuous and immediate literary success, Seneca\\nif anyone is the founder of the Essay. As Francis Bacon put it to Prince Henry in the dedication\\nof his own Essays: „The word is late, but the thing is auncient. For Senecaes Epistles to Lucilius,\\nyf one marke them well, are but Essaies, that is, dispersed Meditacions, thoughe conveyed in the\\nforme of Epistles.‟ The Epistulae Morales are essays in disguise. It has been said39 that they were\\nreal letters edited for publication. It seems most likely that they were intended from the first for\\npublication, possibly preceded by an interval of private circulation. No replies have come down\\nto us.\\nThe atmosphere varies from that of lively, not to say colloquial, conversation to that of\\nthe serious treatise; it is occasionally raised to higher levels,40 but generally remains informal.\\nThe „teaching‟ is generously eclectic; the first thirty letters each contain some quotation from or\\nreference to writings of the main rival philosophical school, the Epicureans. The introduction of\\nimaginary queries or objections (often scathing in tone) from the correspondent or another\\ninterjector and the frequent and urgent exhortation of the listener to self-improvement suggest\\nthe atmosphere of the diatribe, while confidences about the writer‟s own character and the not\\nuncommon choice of consolation or friendship as a theme serve to keep up the air of the letter.\\nPersonal happenings or surroundings are regularly made the occasion of, or the preliminary to,\\nserious reflections in the abstract. There are also biting condemnations of ways of life around the\\nwriter, particularly among the bored and pleasure-seeking Roman aristocracy. Room is found too\\nfor culture, in an assimilable form, in balanced discussions of time-honoured philosophical or\\nethical problems,41 or in the development of thoughts on, for example, poetry, or physical\\n\\n\\x0cphenomena, or style.\\n*\\nHis style\\n\\nStyle, with Seneca, is of considerable importance. Notwithstanding his own\\ncondemnation42 of people who give less attention to what they have to say than to how they will\\nsay it, he is a signal example of a writer to whom form mattered as much as content. In writers\\nlike him (in what has commonly been called the Silver Age of Latin literature), constant striving\\nafter terseness and originality of expression gave rise to an arresting and not easily digested style.\\nThere were reasons for the development of this „pointed‟ style. With the passing of the\\nRepublic and succession of a series of suspicious emperors there had been a diminution both in\\nthe range of subject-matter which was safe and in the practical value of a training in rhetoric for\\na career in public life. The leisured Roman (now increasingly over-leisured) turned his training\\nto literary rather than political ends; and the means to the prime new end of stylistic brilliance\\nwere those of rhetoric. All this was encouraged by the fashion of giving public readings of one‟s\\nwork, in which success almost came to be measured by the ability of each and every sentence to\\nwin applause. Carried over, too, from the schools of rhetoric was a liking for sometimes daringly\\npoetic words, especially from Virgil, and artificial forms of expression more typical of verse than\\nprose.\\nGoing with the overriding aim of pithiness or epigrammatic brevity (contrasting so\\ngreatly with the style of Cicero a century before) was an indulgence in colloquialisms. Seneca‟s\\nuse of popular turns of phrase and everyday expressions (a practice rare in Roman authors not\\nwriting for the comic stage or on technical subjects) and deliberate cultivation of the easy,\\nconversational manner are somehow reconciled with elements of style, even in the Letters, which\\nto us seem highly wrought and polished. The exploitation of such figures as antithesis,\\nalliteration, homeoteleuta and all manner of other plays upon words, paradox and oxymoron,\\napposition and asyndeton, the use of cases and prepositions in uncommon connotations, all\\ncontribute to the twin aims of brevity and sparkle.\\nThe result may read more naturally in Latin than it ever could in English, but is none the\\nless apt to leave the reader „dazzled and fatigued‟.43 All the wealth and ingenuity of epigram and\\nillustration does not prevent us from feeling that the sentences often simply „repeat the same\\nthought, clothed in constantly different guises, over and over again‟, as Fronto complained in the\\ncentury following. And this reluctance, as it appears, to say what one has to say and then have\\ndone with it instead of continuing the restless manufacture of yet bolder, more hard-hitting or\\nmore finished sentences or proverbs, sometimes arouses the impatience of more modern readers.\\nThere is Macaulay‟s celebrated statement in a letter to a friend: „I cannot bear Seneca… His\\nworks are made up of mottoes. There is hardly a sentence which might not be quoted; but to read\\nhim straightforward is like dining on nothing but anchovy sauce.‟ Quintilian44 considered that\\nSeneca, whom by and large he respected and admired, weakened the force of his teaching by his\\nmanner of writing, and others have wondered whether his style is not unworthy of his subject.\\nIt is interesting to hear Quintilian speaking of his struggle to win his students away from\\nsuch models as Seneca (who, he said, „practically alone among authors was to be found on the\\nshelves of every young man at that time‟). As an academician who stood for orthodoxy and a\\nreturn to the older or Ciceronian manner, he could not bring himself to give the seal of his\\napproval to an author whose writing showed, in his opinion, „a degree of corruption all the more\\ndangerous through the very attractiveness of the faults in which it abounds‟, and who had\\n\\n\\x0cactually voiced the heresy: „There are no fixed rules of style.‟45\\n*\\nHis influence and appeal\\n\\nWhile scholars and schoolmasters in the century following continued to condemn46\\nSeneca, early Christians were taking to this kindred spirit among pagan writers, so many of\\nwhose ideas and attitudes they felt able to adopt or share. Anthologies were made of him and he\\nwas frequently quoted by such writers as Jerome, Lactantius and Augustine. Tertullian called\\nhim saepe noster, „often one of us‟. The extant set of letters purporting to be correspondence\\nbetween Seneca and St Paul (probably composed by a Christian, but apparently believed genuine\\nuntil quite modern times) led Jerome to include him in his so called Catalogue of Saints, and no\\ndoubt helps to explain his reputation in the middle ages, much as the supposed prophecy of the\\nbirth of the Messiah in Virgil‟s Fourth Eclogue helped to make the latter‟s name in Christendom.\\nOnly Cicero, perhaps, among classical authors was better known in medieval times, and\\nuntil Aristotle was rediscovered by Western Europe, Seneca‟s main „scientific‟ work, the\\nNaturales Quaestiones, was the undisputed authority on the subjects with which it dealt. Dante,\\nChaucer and Petrarch were great admirers and quoters of his writings.47 Printing spread his\\ninfluence, the first printed version of the Epistulae being published in or about 1475 at Rome,\\nParis and Strasbourg. Erasmus48 was the first person to produce a critical edition (in 1515) and\\nCalvin‟s first work was an edition in 1532 of the De Clementia, an essay originally written to\\nencourage clemency in Nero, and incidentally inspiring much of the „quality of mercy‟ speech in\\nthe Merchant of Venice.\\nMontaigne49 was the first, and the most conspicuously indebted, borrower from Seneca\\namong the great modern literary figures. Pasquier‟s admiration for Montaigne prompted him to\\nsay: „As for his essays, which I call masterpieces, there is no book in my possession which I have\\nso greatly cherished. I always find something in it to please me. It is a French Seneca.‟\\nAppreciations of Seneca as a moralist may be quoted from many sources. John of\\nSalisbury is supposed to have said: „If Quintilian will excuse my saying so, there are very few if\\nany writers on conduct among non-Christians whose words and ideas can be more readily\\napplied to all kinds of practical things.‟ Emerson urged: „Make your own Bible. Select and\\ncollect all the words and sentences that in all your reading have been to you like the blast of\\ntriumph out of Shakespeare, Seneca, Moses, John and Paul.‟ He is placed in even more exalted\\ncompany by Baudelaire in his essay De l’Essence du Rire, in which he seems at one point to be\\nascribing modern civilized manners to ‘la venue de Jésus, Platon et Sénèque aidant’. In letters to\\nPeter Gilles we find Erasmus writing (in the words of Froude) „in fraternal good humour,\\nadvising him to be regular at his work, to keep a journal, to remember that life was short, to\\nstudy Plato and Seneca, love his wife, and disregard the world‟s opinion‟. Queen Elizabeth I „did\\nmuch admire Seneca‟s wholesome advisings‟, says her godson, Sir John Harington, who „saw\\nmuch of her translating thereof‟.50 Although great literary figures have usually been fondest of\\nthe letters, it was his plays which, with all their faults, had the greatest effect on European\\nliterature. „If you seek Seneca‟s memorial, look round on the tragic stage of England, France and\\nItaly.‟51\\nThe late Elizabethan age and early seventeenth century were the high-water mark of\\nSeneca‟s influence, as a writer well known and imitated among lyric poets and essayists as well\\nas dramatists.52 His popularity lasted for some time in France, where his admirers included\\nDescartes, Corneille, La Fontaine, Poussin, Rousseau, Diderot, Balzac and Sainte-Beuve, but\\n\\n\\x0cdisappeared almost altogether in England. The enthusiasm of, for example, De Quincey („A\\nnobler master of thinking Paganism has not to shew, nor, when the cant of criticism has done its\\nworst, a more brilliant master of composition‟) is exceptional, and Seneca, at the present time,\\nmay be called a forgotten author.\\n\\nNOTE ON TRANSLATION AND TEXT\\nTranslations, and the aims and methods (when they are venturesome enough to profess\\nthem) of individual translators, are seldom hard to criticize. But however far men of letters may\\nfind themselves from agreement on the principles of translation from a classical author, the\\nintelligent reader can no longer be satisfied with either a literal rendering – on the painful model\\nof the old-fashioned school crib – or an inspired paraphrase – however attractive the result has\\nsometimes been when poet has rendered poet. Somewhere between these two kinds of offering\\nlies the ideal translation, the aim of which I should define as the exact reproduction of the\\noriginal without omission or addition, capturing its sound (form, style) as well as its sense\\n(content, meaning).\\nReproduction of the style presents, except with ordinary conversational or colloquial\\nprose, formidable problems. The practitioner feels that the attempt is one which should be made,\\neven, in the case of poetry, with so difficult a feature of it as its metrical patterns. Yet the result\\nmust never be English so unnatural or contrived (unless the original itself clearly set out to obtain\\nsuch effects) that the reader cannot stomach it. And this consideration has tempered my feeling\\nthat the brevity or rhetoric or other elements of Seneca‟s manner should each be closely imitated.\\nIt is hardly possible, for instance, to reproduce the compression of such a sentence as Habere\\neripitur, habuisse numquam or Magis quis veneris quam quo interest. In this field of style it is\\nnever possible to claim that a translation „loses nothing‟ of the qualities of the original.\\nFor when all is said and done a translation of a literary work must be readable. To spare\\nthe reader the jars which remind him that he is reading a translation, all but the few timeless\\nversions of the classical authors need to be revised or done afresh perhaps every half century.\\nThe same principle incidentally suggests that obscurities (allusions, for example, which only a\\nLatinist would notice or appreciate) may be clarified or removed by slight expansion, and I have\\nadopted this practice very occasionally as an alternative to a distracting reference to a note.\\nThe formal beginning and ending of each letter (Seneca Lucilio suo salutem and Vale) is\\nomitted. Colloquialisms (including the forms „it‟s‟, „wouldn‟t‟, etc. and the everyday habit of\\nending sentences with prepositions) will be noticed here and there; they have been used only\\nwhere Seneca‟s language is thoroughly colloquial or where he is arguing in the second person\\nwith an imaginary interjector.\\nIf an earlier translator has hit on a phrase which one becomes (unwillingly) convinced\\ncannot be bettered, it is surely absurd – the more so if one believes that there is almost always\\nonly one best rendering in the language of the translator‟s day – to proceed with a poorer or less\\naccurate one merely for the sake of originality. I am indebted in this way in a number of places to\\nGummere and Barker, the translators in the Loeb (1917–25) and Clarendon Press (1932) versions\\nrespectively.\\nThe translation, originally based on Beltrami‟s text (1931), has been brought into line\\nwith the Oxford Classical Text (1965) of Mr L. D. Reynolds, to whom I am grateful for help on\\nseveral points of difficulty. My appreciation is extended also to various friends who may not well\\nrecall the help or interest and encouragement at one time or another given by them, and among\\nthem to my former tutors Mr T. C. W. Stinton and Mr J. P. V. D. Balsdon, who have rescued me\\n\\n\\x0cfrom a number of heresies in the parts of this work which they have seen. My thanks are due also\\nto Dr Michael Grant for permission to reprint from The Annals of Imperial Rome (Penguin\\nBooks, 1956) his translation of Tacitus‟ account of Seneca‟s death.\\nIt may be asked what criteria have been applied in deciding which letters should be\\nincluded or omitted. The first has been their interest – as they set out a philosophy and contribute\\nto a picture of a man and of his times. The second has been the avoidance of undue repetition of\\nparticular themes or topics of a moralist who tends towards repetitiveness. For similar reasons\\none or two of the letters have been shortened by the omission of a few passages (at places\\nindicated). My ultimate defence must be the anthologist‟s plea, or confession, that the choice has\\nbeen a personal one.\\n\\nPOSTSCRIPT TO INTRODUCTION\\nIt is perhaps hard to resist quoting here (in no way seeking to disarm criticism!) from the\\npreface and postscript to the anthology Seneca’s Morals by Way of Abstract published by Sir\\nRoger L‟Estrange in 1673:\\nSome other Man, in my Place, would perchance, make you twenty Apologies, for his\\nwant of Skill, and Address, in governing this Affair, but these are Formal, and Pedantique\\nFooleries: As if any Man that first takes himself for a Coxcomb in his own Heart, would\\nafterwards make himself one in Print too. This Abstract, such as it is, you are extremely welcome\\nto; and I am sorry it is no better, both for your sakes and my own: for if it were written up to the\\nSpirit of the Original, it would be one of the most valuable Presents that ever any private Man\\nbestow‟d upon the Publick:\\nBooks, and Dishes have this Common Fate; there was never any One, of Either of them,\\nthat pleas’d All Palates. And, in Truth, it is a Thing as little to be Wish‟d for, as Expected; For,\\nan Universal Applause is at least Two Thirds of a Scandal. So that though I deliver up these\\nPapers to the Press, I invite no Man to the Reading of them: And, whosoever Reads, and\\nRepents; it is his Own Fault. To Conclude, as I made this Composition Principally for my Self, so\\nit agrees exceedingly Well with My Constitution; and yet, if any Man has a Mind to take part\\nwith me, he has Free Leave, and Welcome. But, let him Carry this Consideration along with him,\\nthat He‟s a very Unmannerly Guest, that presses upon another Bodies Table, and then Quarrels\\nwith his Dinner.\\n\\n\\x0cLETTERS\\n\\nLETTER II\\nJUDGING from what you tell me and from what I hear, I feel that you show great\\npromise. You do not tear from place to place and unsettle yourself with one move after another.\\nRestlessness of that sort is symptomatic of a sick mind. Nothing, to my way of thinking, is a\\nbetter proof of a well ordered mind than a man‟s ability to stop just where he is and pass some\\ntime in his own company.\\nBe careful, however, that there is no element of discursiveness and desultoriness about\\nthis reading you refer to, this reading of many different authors and books of every description.\\nYou should be extending your stay among writers whose genius is unquestionable, deriving\\nconstant nourishment from them if you wish to gain anything from your reading that will find a\\nlasting place in your mind. To be everywhere is to be nowhere. People who spend their whole\\nlife travelling abroad end up having plenty of places where they can find hospitality but no real\\nfriendships. The same must needs be the case with people who never set about acquiring an\\nintimate acquaintanceship with any one great writer, but skip from one to another, paying flying\\nvisits to them all. Food that is vomited up as soon as it is eaten is not assimilated into the body\\nand does not do one any good; nothing hinders a cure so much as frequent changes of treatment;\\na wound will not heal over if it is being made the subject of experiments with different\\nointments; a plant which is frequently moved never grows strong. Nothing is so useful that it can\\nbe of any service in the mere passing. A multitude of books only gets in one‟s way. So if you are\\nunable to read all the books in your possession, you have enough when you have all the books\\nyou are able to read. And if you say, „But I feel like opening different books at different times‟,\\nmy answer will be this: tasting one dish after another is the sign of a fussy stomach, and where\\nthe foods are dissimilar and diverse in range they lead to contamination of the system, not\\nnutrition. So always read well-tried authors, and if at any moment you find yourself wanting a\\nchange from a particular author, go back to ones you have read before.\\nEach day, too, acquire something which will help you to face poverty, or death, and other\\nills as well. After running over a lot of different thoughts, pick out one to be digested thoroughly\\nthat day. This is what I do myself; out of the many bits I have been reading I, lay hold of one.\\nMy thought for today is something which I found in Epicurus (yes, I actually make a practice of\\ngoing over to the enemy‟s camp – by way of reconnaissance, not as a deserter!). „A cheerful\\npoverty,‟ he says, „is an honourable state.‟ But if it is cheerful it is not poverty at all. It is not the\\nman who has too little who is poor, but the one who hankers after more. What difference does it\\nmake how much there is laid away in a man‟s safe or in his barns, how many head of stock he\\ngrazes or how much capital he puts out at interest, if he is always after what is another‟s and only\\ncounts what he has yet to get, never what he has already. You ask what is the proper limit to a\\nperson‟s wealth? First, having what is essential, and second, having what is enough.\\n\\nLETTER III\\nYOU have sent me a letter by the hand of a „friend‟ of yours, as you call him. And in the\\nnext sentence you warn me to avoid discussing your affairs freely with him, since you are not\\neven in the habit of doing so yourself; in other words you have described him as being a friend\\n\\n\\x0cand then denied this, in one and the same letter. Now if you were using that word in a kind of\\npopular sense and not according to its strict meaning, and calling him a „friend‟ in much the\\nsame way as we refer to candidates as „gentlemen‟ or hail someone with the greeting „my dear\\nfellow‟ if when we meet him his name slips our memory, we can let this pass. But if you are\\nlooking on anyone as a friend when you do not trust him as you trust yourself, you are making a\\ngrave mistake, and have failed to grasp sufficiently the full force of true friendship.\\nCertainly you should discuss everything with a friend; but before you do so, discuss in\\nyour mind the man himself. After friendship is formed you must trust, but before that you must\\njudge. Those people who, contrary to Theophrastus‟ advice, judge a man after they have made\\nhim their friend instead of the other way round, certainly put the cart before the horse. Think for\\na long time whether or not you should admit a given person to your friendship. But when you\\nhave decided to do so, welcome him heart and soul, and speak as unreservedly with him as you\\nwould with yourself. You should, I need hardly say, live in such a way that there is nothing\\nwhich you could not as easily tell your enemy as keep to yourself; but seeing that certain matters\\ndo arise on which convention decrees silence, the things you should share with your friend are all\\nyour worries and deliberations. Regard him as loyal, and you will make him loyal. Some men‟s\\nfear of being deceived has taught people to deceive them; by their suspiciousness they give them\\nthe right to do the wrong thing by them. Why should I keep back anything when I‟m with a\\nfriend? Why shouldn‟t I imagine I‟m alone when I‟m in his company?\\nThere are certain people who tell any person they meet things that should only be\\nconfided to friends, unburdening themselves of whatever is on their minds into any ear they\\nplease. Others again are shy of confiding in their closest friends, and would not even let\\nthemselves, if they could help it, into the secrets they keep hidden deep down inside themselves.\\nWe should do neither. Trusting everyone is as much a fault as trusting no one (though I should\\ncall the first the worthier and the second the safer behaviour).\\nSimilarly, people who never relax and people who are invariably in a relaxed state merit\\nyour disapproval – the former as much as the latter. For a delight in bustling about is not industry\\n– it is only the restless energy of a hunted mind. And the state of mind that looks on all activity\\nas tiresome is not true repose, but a spineless inertia. This prompts me to memorize something\\nwhich I came across in Pomponius. „Some men have shrunk so far into dark corners that objects\\nin bright daylight seem quite blurred to them.‟ A balanced combination of the two attitudes is\\nwhat we want; the active man should be able to take things easily, while the man who is inclined\\ntowards repose should be capable of action. Ask nature: she will tell you that she made both day\\nand night.\\n\\nLETTER V\\nI VIEW with pleasure and approval the way you keep on at your studies and sacrifice\\neverything to your single-minded efforts to make yourself every day a better man. I do not\\nmerely urge you to persevere in this; I actually implore you to. Let me give you, though, this one\\npiece of advice: refrain from following the example of those whose craving is for attention, not\\ntheir own improvement, by doing certain things which are calculated to give rise to comment on\\nyour appearance or way of living generally. Avoid shabby attire, long hair, an unkempt beard, an\\noutspoken dislike of silverware, sleeping on the ground and all other misguided means to\\nself-advertisement. The very name of philosophy, however modest the manner in which it is\\npursued, is unpopular enough as it is: imagine what the reaction would be if we started\\ndissociating ourselves from the conventions of society. Inwardly everything should be different\\n\\n\\x0cbut our outward face should conform with the crowd. Our clothes should not be gaudy, yet they\\nshould not be dowdy either. We should not keep silver plate with inlays of solid gold, but at the\\nsame time we should not imagine that doing without gold and silver is proof that we are leading\\nthe simple life. Let our aim be a way of life not diametrically opposed to, but better than that of\\nthe mob. Otherwise we shall repel and alienate the very people whose reform we desire; we shall\\nmake them, moreover, reluctant to imitate us in anything for fear they may have to imitate us in\\neverything. The first thing philosophy promises us is the feeling of fellowship, of belonging to\\nmankind and being members of a community; being different will mean the abandoning of that\\nmanifesto. We must watch that the means by which we hope to gain admiration do not earn\\nridicule and hostility. Our motto, as everyone knows, is to live in conformity with nature: it is\\nquite contrary to nature to torture one‟s body, to reject simple standards of cleanliness and make\\na point of being dirty, to adopt a diet that is not just plain but hideous and revolting. In the same\\nway as a craving for dainties is a token of extravagant living, avoidance of familiar and\\ninexpensive dishes betokens insanity. Philosophy calls for simple living, not for doing penance,\\nand the simple way of life need not be a crude one. The standard which I accept is this: one‟s life\\nshould be a compromise between the ideal and the popular morality. People should admire our\\nway of life but they should at the same time find it understandable.\\n„Does that mean we are to act just like other people? Is there to be no distinction between\\nus and them?‟ Most certainly there is. Any close observer should be aware that we are different\\nfrom the mob. Anyone entering our homes should admire us rather than our furnishings. It is a\\ngreat man that can treat his earthenware as if it was silver, and a man who treats his silver as if it\\nwas earthenware is no less great. Finding wealth an intolerable burden is the mark of an unstable\\nmind.\\nBut let me share with you as usual the day‟s small find (which today is something that I\\nnoticed in the Stoic writer Hecato). Limiting one‟s desires actually helps to cure one of fear.\\n„Cease to hope,‟ he says, „and you will cease to fear.‟ „But how,‟ you will ask, „can things as\\ndiverse as these be linked?‟ Well, the fact is, Lucilius, that they are bound up with one another,\\nunconnected as they may seem. Widely different though they are, the two of them march in\\nunison like a prisoner and the escort he is handcuffed to. Fear keeps pace with hope. Nor does\\ntheir so moving together surprise me; both belong to a mind in suspense, to a mind in a state of\\nanxiety through looking into the future. Both are mainly due to projecting our thoughts far ahead\\nof us instead of adapting ourselves to the present. Thus it is that foresight, the greatest blessing\\nhumanity has been given, is transformed into a curse. Wild animals run from the dangers they\\nactually see, and once they have escaped them worry no more. We however are tormented alike\\nby what is past and what is to come. A number of our blessings do us harm, for memory brings\\nback the agony of fear while foresight brings it on prematurely. No one confines his unhappiness\\nto the present.\\n\\nLETTER VI\\nI SEE in myself, Lucilius, not just an improvement but a transformation, although I\\nwould not venture as yet to assure you, or even to hope, that there is nothing left in me needing\\nto be changed. Naturally there are a lot of things about me requiring to be built up or fined down\\nor eliminated. Even this, the fact that it perceives the failings it was unaware of in itself before, is\\nevidence of a change for the better in one‟s character. In the case of some sick people it is a\\nmatter for congratulation when they come to realize for themselves that they are sick.\\nI should very much like, then, to share this all so sudden metamorphosis of mine with\\n\\n\\x0cyou. Doing so would make me start to feel a surer faith in the friendship that exists between us,\\nthat true friendship which not hope nor fear nor concern for personal advantage ever sunders,\\nthat friendship in which and for which people are ready to die. I can give you plenty of examples\\nof people who have not been lacking a friend but friendship, something that can never happen\\nwhen mutual inclination draws two personalities together in a fellowship of desire for all that is\\nhonourable. Why cannot it happen? Because they know that everything – and especially their\\nsetbacks – is shared between them.\\nYou can‟t imagine how much of an alteration I see each day bringing about in me. „Send\\nme, too,‟ you will be saying, „the things you‟ve found so effectual.‟ Indeed I desire to transfer\\nevery one of them to you; part of my joy in learning is that it puts me in a position to teach;\\nnothing, however outstanding and however helpful, will ever give me any pleasure if the\\nknowledge is to be for my benefit alone. If wisdom were offered me on the one condition that I\\nshould keep it shut away and not divulge it to anyone, I should reject it. There is no enjoying the\\npossession of anything valuable unless one has someone to share it with. I shall send you,\\naccordingly, the actual books themselves, and to save you a lot of trouble hunting all over the\\nplace for passages likely to be of use to you, I shall mark the passages so that you can turn\\nstraight away to the words I approve and admire.\\nPersonal converse, though, and daily intimacy with someone will be of more benefit to\\nyou than any discourse. You should really be here and on the spot, firstly because people believe\\ntheir eyes rather more than their ears, and secondly because the road is a long one if one\\nproceeds by way of precepts but short and effectual if by way of personal example. Cleanthes\\nwould never have been the image of Zeno if he had merely heard him lecture; he lived with him,\\nstudied his private life, watched him to see if he lived in accordance with his own principle.\\nPlato, Aristotle and a host of other philosophers all destined to take different paths, derived more\\nfrom Socrates‟ character than from his words. It was not Epicurus‟ school but living under the\\nsame roof as Epicurus that turned Metrodorus, Hermarchus and Polyaenus into great men. And\\nyet I do not summon you to my side solely for the sake of your own progress but for my own as\\nwell, for we shall be of the utmost benefit to each other.\\nMeanwhile, since I owe you the daily allowance, I‟ll tell you what took my fancy in the\\nwritings of Hecato today. „What progress have I made? I am beginning to be my own friend.‟\\nThat is progress indeed. Such a person will never be alone, and you may be sure he is a friend of\\nall.\\n\\nLETTER VII\\nYOU ask me to say what you should consider it particularly important to avoid. My\\nanswer is this: a mass crowd. It is something to which you cannot entrust yourself yet without\\nrisk. I at any rate am ready to confess my own frailty in this respect. I never come back home\\nwith quite the same moral character I went out with; something or other becomes unsettled\\nwhere I had achieved internal peace, some one or other of the things I had put to flight reappears\\non the scene. We who are recovering from a prolonged spiritual sickness are in the same\\ncondition as invalids who have been affected to such an extent by prolonged indisposition that\\nthey cannot once be taken out of doors without ill effects. Associating with people in large\\nnumbers is actually harmful: there is not one of them that will not make some vice or other\\nattractive to us, or leave us carrying the imprint of it or bedaubed all unawares with it. And\\ninevitably enough, the larger the size of the crowd we mingle with, the greater the danger. But\\nnothing is as ruinous to the character as sitting away one‟s time at a show – for it is then, through\\n\\n\\x0cthe medium of entertainment, that vices creep into one with more than usual ease. What do you\\ntake me to mean? That I go home more selfish, more self-seeking and more self-indulgent? Yes,\\nand what is more, a person crueller and less humane through having been in contact with human\\nbeings. I happened to go to one of these shows at the time of the lunch-hour interlude, expecting\\nthere to be some light and witty entertainment then, some respite for the purpose of affording\\npeople‟s eyes a rest from human blood. Far from it. All the earlier contests were charity in\\ncomparison. The nonsense is dispensed with now: what we have now is murder pure and simple.\\nThe combatants have nothing to protect them; their whole bodies are exposed to the blows; every\\nthrust they launch gets home. A great many spectators prefer this to the ordinary matches and\\neven to the special, popular demand ones. And quite naturally. There are no helmets and no\\nshields repelling the weapons. What is the point of armour? Or of skill? All that sort of thing just\\nmakes the death slower in coming. In the morning men are thrown to the lions and the bears: but\\nit is the spectators they are thrown to in the lunch hour. The spectators insist that each on killing\\nhis man shall be thrown against another to be killed in his turn; and the eventual victor is\\nreserved by them for some other form of butchery; the only exit for the contestants is death. Fire\\nand steel keep the slaughter going. And all this happens while the arena is virtually empty.\\n„But he was a highway robber, he killed a man.‟ And what of it? Granted that as a\\nmurderer he deserved this punishment, what have you done, you wretched fellow, to deserve to\\nwatch it? „Kill him! Flog him! Burn him! Why does he run at the other man‟s weapon in such a\\ncowardly way? Why isn‟t he less half-hearted about killing? Why isn‟t he a bit more enthusiastic\\nabout dying? Whip him forward to get his wounds! Make them each offer the other a bare breast\\nand trade blow for blow on them.‟ And when there is an interval in the show: „Let‟s have some\\nthroats cut in the meantime, so that there‟s something happening!‟ Come now, I say, surely you\\npeople realize – if you realize nothing else – that bad examples have a way of recoiling on those\\nwho set them? Give thanks to the immortal gods that the men to whom you are giving a lesson in\\ncruelty are not in a position to profit from it.\\nWhen a mind is impressionable and has none too firm a hold on what is right, it must be\\nrescued from the crowd: it is so easy for it to go over to the majority. A Socrates, a Cato or a\\nLaelius might have been shaken in his principles by a multitude of people different from himself:\\nsuch is the measure of the inability of any of us, even as we perfect our personality‟s adjustment,\\nto withstand the onset of vices when they come with such a mighty following. A single example\\nof extravagance or greed does a lot of harm – an intimate who leads a pampered life gradually\\nmakes one soft and flabby; a wealthy neighbour provokes cravings in one; a companion with a\\nmalicious nature tends to rub off some of his rust even on someone of an innocent and\\nopen-hearted nature – what then do you imagine the effect on a person‟s character is when the\\nassault comes from the world at large? You must inevitably either hate or imitate the world. But\\nthe right thing is to shun both courses: you should neither become like the bad because they are\\nmany, nor be an enemy of the many because they are unlike you. Retire into yourself as much as\\nyou can. Associate with people who are likely to improve you. Welcome those whom you are\\ncapable of improving. The process is a mutual one: men learn as they teach. And there is no\\nreason why any pride in advertising your talents abroad should lure you forward into the public\\neye, inducing you to give readings of your works or deliver lectures. I should be glad to see you\\ndoing that if what you had to offer them was suitable for the crowd I have been talking about: but\\nthe fact is, not one of them is really capable of understanding you. You might perhaps come\\nacross one here and there, but even they would need to be trained and developed by you to a\\npoint where they could grasp your teaching. „For whose benefit, then, did I learn it all?‟ If it was\\n\\n\\x0cfor your own benefit that you learnt it you have no call to fear that your trouble may have been\\nwasted.\\nJust to make sure that I have not been learning solely for my own benefit today, let me\\nshare with you three fine quotations I have come across, each concerned with something like the\\nsame idea – one of them is by way of payment of the usual debt so far as this letter is concerned,\\nand the other two you are to regard as an advance on account. „To me,‟ says Democritus, „a\\nsingle man is a crowd, and a crowd is a single man.‟ Equally good is the answer given by the\\nperson, whoever it was (his identity is uncertain), who when asked what was the object of all the\\ntrouble he took over a piece of craftsmanship when it would never reach more than a very few\\npeople, replied: „A few is enough for me; so is one; and so is none.‟ The third is a nice\\nexpression used by Epicurus in a letter to one of his colleagues. „I am writing this,‟ he says, „not\\nfor the eyes of the many, but for yours alone: for each of us is audience enough for the other.‟\\nLay these up in your heart, my dear Lucilius, that you may scorn the pleasure that comes from\\nthe majority‟s approval. The many speak highly of you, but have you really any grounds for\\nsatisfaction with yourself if you are the kind of person the many understand? Your merits should\\nnot be outward facing.\\n\\nLETTER VIII\\n„ARE you, of all people‟, you write, „really telling me to avoid the crowd, to retire from\\nthe world and find contentment in a good conscience? Where are those Stoic rules of yours that\\ncall on a man to die in harness?‟ Come now, do I really give you the impression that I advocate a\\nlife of inactivity? I have only buried myself away behind closed doors in order to be able to be of\\nuse to more people. With me no day is ever whiled away at ease. I claim a good part of my\\nnights for study; I have no time for sleep: I just succumb to it, keeping my eyes at their work\\nwhen they are heavy-lidded and exhausted from lack of rest. I have withdrawn from affairs as\\nwell as from society, and from my own affairs in particular: I am acting on behalf of later\\ngenerations. I am writing down a few things that may be of use to them; I am committing to\\nwriting some helpful recommendations, which might be compared to the formulae of successful\\nmedications, the effectiveness of which I have experienced in the case of my own sores, which\\nmay not have been completely cured but have at least ceased to spread. I am pointing out to\\nothers the right path, which I have recognized only late in life, when I am worn out with my\\nwanderings. „Avoid,‟ I cry, „whatever is approved of by the mob, and things that are the gift of\\nchance. Whenever circumstance brings some welcome thing your way, stop in suspicion and\\nalarm: wild animals and fish alike are taken in by this or that inviting prospect. Do you look on\\nthem as presents given you by fortune? They are snares. Anyone among you who wishes to lead\\na secure life will do his very best to steer well wide of these baited bounties, which comprise yet\\nanother instance of the errors we miserable creatures fall into: we think these things are ours\\nwhen in fact it is we who are caught. That track leads to precipices; life on that giddy level ends\\nin a fall. Once, moreover, prosperity begins to carry us off course, we are no more capable even\\nof bringing the ship to a standstill than of going down with the consolation that she has been held\\non her course, or of going down once and for all; fortune does not just capsize the boat: she hurls\\nit headlong on the rocks and dashes it to pieces. Cling, therefore, to this sound and wholesome\\nplan of life: indulge the body just so far as suffices for good health. It needs to be treated\\nsomewhat strictly to prevent it from being disobedient to the spirit. Your food should appease\\nyour hunger, your drink quench your thirst, your clothing keep out the cold, your house be a\\nprotection against inclement weather. It makes no difference whether it is built of turf or of\\n\\n\\x0cvariegated marble imported from another country: what you have to understand is that thatch\\nmakes a person just as good a roof as gold does. Spurn everything that is added on by way of\\ndecoration and display by unnecessary labour. Reflect that nothing merits admiration except the\\nspirit, the impressiveness of which prevents it from being impressed by anything.‟\\nIf these are the things I‟m saying to myself, if these are the things I‟m saying to future\\ngenerations, don‟t you think I‟m doing more good than when I go into court to enter into a\\nrecognizance on someone‟s behalf, or stamp my seal on a will, or lend my assistance by word or\\naction in the Senate to some candidate for office? Those who appear inactive are, believe me,\\nengaged in far more important activity; they‟re dealing with matters divine and human at the\\nsame moment.\\nBut the time has come to make an end, and in accordance with the practice I‟ve started to\\nmake some disbursement on this letter‟s behalf. For this I shall not draw on my own resources.\\nI‟m still turning over the pages of Epicurus, and the following saying, one I read today, comes\\nfrom him: „To win true freedom you must be a slave to philosophy.‟ A person who surrenders\\nand subjects himself to her doesn‟t have his application deferred from day to day; he‟s\\nemancipated on the spot, the very service of philosophy being freedom.\\nQuite possibly you‟ll be demanding to know why I‟m quoting so many fine sayings from\\nEpicurus rather than ones belonging to our own school. But why should you think of them as\\nbelonging to Epicurus and not as common property? Think how many poets say things that\\nphilosophers have said – or ought to have said! Not to mention the tragedians or our native\\nRoman drama (which has a serious element in it as well and stands halfway between comedy and\\ntragedy), think of the quantity of brilliant lines to be found lying about in farces alone! Think of\\nthe number of Publilius‟ verses that really ought to be spoken by actors wearing the tragic\\nbuskins instead of barefooted pantomime actors! I‟ll quote one verse of his which belongs to\\nphilosophy, and the same facet of philosophy that I was occupied with just now, a verse in which\\nhe proclaims that gifts which chance brings our way are not to be regarded as possessions:\\nIf you pray a thing may\\nAnd it does come your way,\\n‟Tis a long way from being your own.\\nI recall your expressing the same idea a good deal more happily and succinctly:\\nWhat fortune has made yours is not your own.\\nAnd I can‟t pass over that even happier expression of yours:\\nThe boon that could be given can be withdrawn.\\n(This being from your own stock, I‟m not debiting it to your account!)\\n\\nLETTER IX\\nYOU desire to know whether Epicurus is right in one of his letters in criticizing those\\nwho maintain that the wise man is content with himself and therefore needs no friend. This is\\nwhat Epicurus objects to in Stilbo and those* who believe that the supreme ideal in life is a mind\\ndevoid of feeling or as we say impatiens. We are bound to involve ourselves in ambiguity if we\\ntry to express in a single word the meaning of the Greek term apatheia by transferring it straight\\ninto our word impatientia. For it may be understood in the opposite sense to the one we wish,\\nwith people taking it to signify the man who is unable to endure anything that goes badly for him\\ninstead of what we mean by it, the man who refuses to allow anything that goes badly for him to\\naffect him. Consider then whether it might not be preferable to call it a mind that is\\n„invulnerable‟ or „above all suffering‟.\\n\\n\\x0cThe difference here between the Epicurean and our own school is this: our wise man feels\\nhis troubles but overcomes them, while their wise man does not even feel them. We share with\\nthem the belief that the wise man is content with himself. Nevertheless, self-sufficient though he\\nis, he still desires a friend, a neighbour, a companion. Notice how self-contented he is: on\\noccasion such a man is content with a mere partial self – if he loses a hand as a result of war or\\ndisease, or has one of his eyes, or even both, put out in an accident, he will be satisfied with what\\nremains of himself and be no less pleased with his body now that it is maimed and incomplete\\nthan he was when it was whole. But while he does not hanker after what he has lost, he does\\nprefer not to lose them. And this is what we mean when we say the wise man is self-content; he\\nis so in the sense that he is able to do without friends, not that he desires to do without them.\\nWhen I speak of his being „able‟ to do this, what I am saying in fact amounts to this: he bears the\\nloss of a friend with equanimity.\\nNot that he will then be without a friend, for it is his to decide how soon he makes good\\nthe loss. Just as Phidias can carve another statue straight away if he loses one, so our wise man\\nwith his skill in the art of making friends will fill the place of someone he has lost. I suppose you\\nwill want to know how he will be able to make a friend so quickly. Well, I shall tell you\\n(provided we agree that I may make this the moment to pay my debt and square my account so\\nfar as this letter is concerned). „I shall show you,‟ said Hecato, „a love philtre compounded\\nwithout drug or herb or witch‟s spell. It is this: if you wish to be loved, love.‟\\nGreat pleasure is to be found not only in keeping up an old and established friendship but\\nalso in beginning and building up a new one. There is the same difference between having\\ngained a friend and actually gaining a friend as there is between a farmer harvesting and a farmer\\nsowing. The philosopher Attalus used to say that it was more of a pleasure to make a friend than\\nto have one, „in the same way as an artist derives more pleasure from painting than from having\\ncompleted a picture‟. When his whole attention is absorbed in concentration on the work he is\\nengaged on, a tremendous sense of satisfaction is created in him by his very absorption. There is\\nnever quite the same gratification after he has lifted his hand from the finished work. From then\\non what he is enjoying is the art‟s end product, whereas it was the art itself that he enjoyed while\\nhe was actually painting. So with our children, their growing up brings wider fruits but their\\ninfancy was sweeter.\\nTo come back to the question, the wise man, self-sufficient as he is, still desires to have a\\nfriend if only for the purpose of practising friendship and ensuring that those talents are not idle.\\nNot, as Epicurus put it in the same letter, „for the purpose of having someone to come and sit\\nbeside his bed when he is ill or come to his rescue when he is hard up or thrown into chains‟, but\\nso that on the contrary he may have someone by whose sickbed he himself may sit or whom he\\nmay himself release when that person is held prisoner by hostile hands. Anyone thinking of his\\nown interests and seeking out friendship with this in view is making a great mistake. Things will\\nend as they began; he has secured a friend who is going to come to his aid if captivity threatens:\\nat the first clank of a chain that friend will disappear. These are what are commonly called\\nfair-weather friendships. A person adopted as a friend for the sake of his usefulness will be\\ncultivated only for so long as he is useful. This explains the crowd of friends that clusters about\\nsuccessful men and the lonely atmosphere about the ruined – their friends running away when it\\ncomes to the testing point; it explains the countless scandalous instances of people deserting or\\nbetraying others out of fear for themselves. The ending inevitably matches the beginning: a\\nperson who starts being friends with you because it pays him will similarly cease to be friends\\nbecause it pays him to do so. If there is anything in a particular friendship that attracts a man\\n\\n\\x0cother than the friendship itself, the attraction of some reward or other will counterbalance that of\\nthe friendship. What is my object in making a friend? To have someone to be able to die for,\\nsomeone I may follow into exile, someone for whose life I may put myself up as security and\\npay the price as well. The thing you describe is not friendship but a business deal, looking to the\\nlikely consequences, with advantage as its goal. There can be no doubt that the desire lovers have\\nfor each other is not so very different from friendship – you might say it was friendship gone\\nmad. Well, then, does anyone ever fall in love with a view to a profit, or advancement, or\\ncelebrity? Actual love in itself, heedless of all other considerations, inflames people‟s hearts with\\na passion for the beautiful object, not without the hope, too, that the affection will be mutual.\\nHow then can the nobler stimulus of friendship be associated with any ignoble desire?\\nYou may say we are not at present concerned with the question whether friendship is\\nsomething to be cultivated for its own sake. But this, on the contrary, is exactly what needs\\nproving most; for if friendship is something to be sought out for its own sake, the self-contented\\nman is entitled to pursue it. And how does he approach it? In the same way as he would any\\nobject of great beauty, not drawn by gain, not out of alarm at the vicissitudes of fortune. To\\nprocure friendship only for better and not for worse is to rob it of all its dignity.\\n„The wise man is content with himself.‟ A lot of people, Lucilius, put quite the wrong\\ninterpretation on this statement. They remove the wise man from all contact with the world\\noutside, shutting him up inside his own skin. We must be quite clear about the meaning of this\\nsentence and just how much it claims to say. It applies to him so far as happiness in life is\\nconcerned: for this all he needs is a rational and elevated spirit that treats fortune with disdain;\\nfor the actual business of living he needs a great number of things. I should like to draw your\\nattention to a similar distinction made by Chrysippus. The wise man, he said, lacked nothing but\\nneeded a great number of things, whereas „the fool, on the other hand, needs nothing (for he does\\nnot know how to use anything) but lacks everything.‟ The wise man needs hands and eyes and a\\ngreat number of things that are required for the purposes of day-to-day life; but he lacks nothing,\\nfor lacking something implies that it is a necessity and nothing, to the wise man, is a necessity.\\nSelf-contented as he is, then, he does need friends – and wants as many of them as\\npossible – but not to enable him to lead a happy life; this he will have even without friends. The\\nsupreme ideal does not call for any external aids. It is homegrown, wholly self-developed. Once\\nit starts looking outside itself for any part of itself it is on the way to being dominated by fortune.\\n„But what sort of life,‟ people may say, „will the wise man have if he is going to be left\\nwithout any friends when he is thrown into prison or stranded among foreigners or detained in\\nthe course of a voyage in distant parts or cast away on some desert shore?‟ It will be like that of\\nJove while nature takes her rest, of brief duration, when the universe is dissolved and the gods\\nare all merged in one, finding repose in himself, absorbed in his own thoughts. Such is more or\\nless the way of the wise man: he retires to his inner self, is his own company. So long in fact as\\nhe remains in a position to order his affairs according to his own judgement, he remains\\nself-content even when he marries, even when he brings up his children. He is self-content and\\nyet he would refuse to live if he had to live without any human company at all. Natural\\npromptings (not thoughts of any advantage to himself) impel him towards friendship. We are\\nborn with a sense of the pleasantness of friendship just as of other things. In the same way as\\nthere exists in man a distaste for solitude and a craving for society, natural instinct drawing one\\nhuman being to another, so too with this there is something inherent in it that stimulates us into\\nseeking friendships. The wise man, nevertheless, unequalled though he is in his devotion to his\\nfriends, though regarding them as being no less important and frequently more important than his\\n\\n\\x0cown self, will still consider what is valuable in life to be something wholly confined to his inner\\nself. He will repeat the words of Stilbo (the Stilbo whom Epicurus‟ letter attacks), when his\\nhome town was captured and he emerged from the general conflagration, his children lost, his\\nwife lost, alone and none the less a happy man, and was questioned by Demetrius. Asked by this\\nman, known, from the destruction he dealt out to towns, as Demetrius the City Sacker, whether\\nhe had lost anything, he replied, „I have all my valuables with me.‟ There was an active and\\ncourageous man – victorious over the very victory of the enemy! „I have lost,‟ he said, „nothing.‟\\nHe made Demetrius wonder whether he had won a victory after all. „All my possessions,‟ he\\nsaid, „are with me‟, meaning by this the qualities of a just, a good and an enlightened character,\\nand indeed the very fact of not regarding as valuable anything that is capable of being taken\\naway. We are impressed at the way some creatures pass right through fire without physical harm:\\nhow much more impressive is the way this man came through the burning and the bloodshed and\\nthe ruins uninjured and unscathed. Does it make you see how much easier it can be to conquer a\\nwhole people than to conquer a single man? Those words of Stilbo‟s are equally those of the\\nStoic. He too carries his valuables intact through cities burnt to ashes, for he is contented with\\nhimself. This is the line he draws as the boundary for his happiness.\\nIn case you imagine that we Stoics are the only people who produce noble sayings, let me\\ntell you something – see that you put this down to my credit, even though I have already settled\\nmy account with you for today – Epicurus himself, who has nothing good to say for Stilbo, has\\nuttered a statement quite like this one of Stilbo‟s. „Any man,‟ he says, „who does not think that\\nwhat he has is more than ample, is an unhappy man, even if he is the master of the whole world.‟\\nOr if you prefer to see it expressed like this (the point being that we should be ruled not by the\\nactual words used but by the sense of them), „a man is unhappy, though he reign the world over,\\nif he does not consider himself supremely happy.‟ To show you, indeed, that these are sentiments\\nof a universal character, prompted, evidently, by nature herself, you will find the following verse\\nin a comic poet:\\nNot happy he who thinks himself not so.*\\nWhat difference does it make, after all, what your position in life is if you dislike it\\nyourself?\\n„What about so-and-so,‟ you may ask, „who became rich in such a despicable manner, or\\nsuch-and-such a person who gives orders to a great many people but is at the mercy of a great\\nmany more? Supposing they say they are happy, will their own opinions to this effect make them\\nhappy?‟ It does not make any difference what a man says; what matters is how he feels, and not\\nhow he feels on one particular day but how he feels at all times. But you have no need to fear\\nthat so valuable a thing may fall into unworthy hands. Only the wise man is content with what is\\nhis. All foolishness suffers the burden of dissatisfaction with itself.\\n\\nLETTER XI\\nI HAVE had a conversation with your talented friend. From the very beginning of his talk\\nwith me it was apparent what considerable gifts of character and intelligence he possesses. He\\ngave me a foretaste of his capabilities, to which he will certainly live up, for the things he said,\\ncaught as he was quite off his guard, were entirely unrehearsed. As he was recovering his\\nself-possession, he could scarcely get over his embarrassment – always a good sign in a young\\nman – so deep had the blush been that suffused his face. This I rather suspect will remain with\\nhim even when he has built up his character and stripped it of all weakness – even when he has\\nbecome a wise man. For no amount of wisdom enables one to do away with physical or mental\\n\\n\\x0cweaknesses that arise from natural causes; anything inborn or ingrained in one can by dint of\\npractice be allayed, but not overcome. When they face a crowd of people some men, even ones\\nwith the stoutest of hearts, break into the sort of sweat one usually sees on persons in an\\noverheated and exhausted state; some men experience a trembling at the knees when they are\\nabout to speak; some a chattering of the teeth, a stuttering tongue or stammering lips. These are\\nthings which neither training nor experience ever eliminates. Nature just wields her power and\\nuses the particular weakness to make even the strongest conscious of her. One of these things I\\nwell know is a blush, which has a habit of suddenly reddening the faces of men of even the most\\ndignified demeanour. It is of course more noticeable in the young, with their hotter blood and\\nsensitive complexions; nevertheless seasoned men and ageing men alike are affected by it. Some\\nmen are more to be feared on the occasions when they flush than at any other time – as if in so\\ndoing they let loose all their inhibitions; Sulla was at his wildest when the blood had rushed to\\nhis visage. No features were more susceptible than Pompey‟s: he never failed to blush in\\ncompany, and particularly at public meetings. I remember Fabianus blushing when he appeared\\nto give evidence before the Senate, and this bashfulness looked wonderfully well on him. When\\nthis happens it is not due to some mental infirmity, but to the unfamiliarity of some situation or\\nother, which may not necessarily strike any alarm into inexperienced people but does produce a\\nreaction in them if they are thus liable through having a natural, physical predisposition to it;\\ncertain people have good, ordinary blood and others just have an animated, lively sort of blood\\nthat comes to the face quickly.\\nNo amount of wisdom, as I said before, ever banishes these things; otherwise – if she\\neradicated every weakness – wisdom would have dominion over the world of nature. One‟s\\nphysical make-up and the attributes that were one‟s lot at birth remain settled no matter how\\nmuch or how long the personality may strive after perfect adjustment. One cannot ban these\\nthings any more than one can call them up. The tokens used to portray embarrassment by\\nprofessional actors, those actors who portray emotion, simulate unhappiness and reproduce for us\\nfear and apprehension, are a hanging of the head, a dropping of the voice, a casting down of the\\neyes and keeping them fixed on the ground; a blush is something they can never manage to\\nreproduce; it is something that will neither be summoned up nor be told to stay away. Against\\nthese things philosophy holds out no remedy and avails one nothing; they are quite independent;\\nthey come unbidden, they go unbidden.\\nMy letter calls for a conclusion. Here‟s one for you, one that will serve you in good stead,\\ntoo, which I‟d like you to take to heart. „We need to set our affections on some good man and\\nkeep him constantly before our eyes, so that we may live as if he were watching us and do\\neverything as if he saw what we were doing.‟ This, my dear Lucilius, is Epicurus‟ advice, and in\\ngiving it he has given us a guardian and a moral tutor – and not without reason, either: misdeeds\\nare greatly diminished if a witness is always standing near intending doers. The personality\\nshould be provided with someone it can revere, someone whose influence can make even its\\nprivate, inner life more pure. Happy the man who improves other people not merely when he is\\nin their presence but even when he is in their thoughts! And happy, too, is the person who can so\\nrevere another as to adjust and shape his own personality in the light of recollections, even, of\\nthat other. A person able to revere another thus will soon deserve to be revered himself. So\\nchoose yourself a Cato – or, if Cato seems too severe for you, a Laelius, a man whose character\\nis not quite so strict. Choose someone whose way of life as well as words, and whose very face\\nas mirroring the character that lies behind it, have won your approval. Be always pointing him\\nout to yourself either as your guardian or as your model. There is a need, in my view, for\\n\\n\\x0csomeone as a standard against which our characters can measure themselves. Without a ruler to\\ndo it against you won‟t make the crooked straight.\\n\\nLETTER XII\\nWHEREVER I turn I see fresh evidence of my old age. I visited my place just out of\\nRome recently and was grumbling about the expense of maintaining the building, which was in a\\ndilapidated state. My manager told me the trouble wasn‟t due to any neglect on his part: he was\\ndoing his utmost but the house was old. That house had taken shape under my own hands; what‟s\\nto become of me if stones of my own age are crumbling like that? Losing my temper I seized at\\nthe first excuse that presented itself for venting my irritation on him. „It‟s quite clear,‟ I said,\\n„that these plane trees are being neglected. There‟s no foliage on them. Look at those knotty,\\ndried-up branches and those wretched, flaking trunks. That wouldn‟t happen if someone dug\\nround them and watered them.‟ He swore by my guardian angel he was doing his utmost: in\\neverything his care was unremitting but the poor things were just old. Between you and me, now,\\nI had planted them myself and seen the first leaf appearing on them myself. Then, turning\\ntowards the front door, I said: „Who‟s that? Who‟s that decrepit old person? The door‟s the\\nproper place for him all right – he looks as if he‟s on the way out. Where did you get him from?\\nWhat was the attraction in taking over someone else‟s dead for burial?‟ Whereupon the man said,\\n„Don‟t you recognize me? I‟m Felicio. You used to bring me toy figures.* I‟m the son of the\\nmanager Philositus, your pet playmate.‟ „The man‟s absolutely crazy,‟ I said. „Become a little\\nchild again, has he, actually calls himself my playmate? Well, the way he‟s losing his teeth at\\nthis very moment, it‟s perfectly possible.‟\\nSo I owe it to this place of mine near town that my old age was made clear to me at every\\nturn. Well, we should cherish old age and enjoy it. It is full of pleasure if you know how to use it.\\nFruit tastes most delicious just when its season is ending. The charms of youth are at their\\ngreatest at the time of its passing. It is the final glass which pleases the inveterate drinker, the one\\nthat sets the crowning touch on his intoxication and sends him off into oblivion. Every pleasure\\ndefers till its last its greatest delights. The time of life which offers the greatest delight is the age\\nthat sees the downward movement – not the steep decline – already begun; and in my opinion\\neven the age that stands on the brink has pleasures of its own – or else the very fact of not\\nexperiencing the want of any pleasures takes their place. How nice it is to have outworn one‟s\\ndesires and left them behind!\\n„It‟s not very pleasant, though,‟ you may say, „to have death right before one‟s eyes.‟ To\\nthis I would say, firstly, that death ought to be right there before the eyes of a young man just as\\nmuch as an old one – the order in which we each receive our summons is not determined by our\\nprecedence in the register – and, secondly, that no one is so very old that it would be quite\\nunnatural for him to hope for one more day.…*\\nEvery day, therefore, should be regulated as if it were the one that brings up the rear, the\\none that rounds out and completes our lives. Pacuvius, the man who acquired a right to Syria by\\nprescription,53 was in the habit of conducting a memorial ceremony for himself with wine and\\nfuneral feasting of the kind we are familiar with, and then being carried on a bier from the dinner\\ntable to his bed, while a chanting to music went on of the words „He has lived, he has lived‟ in\\nGreek, amid the applause of the young libertines present. Never a day passed but he celebrated\\nhis own funeral. What he did from discreditable motives we should do from honourable ones,\\nsaying in all joyfulness and cheerfulness as we retire to our beds,\\nI have lived; I have completed now the course\\n\\n\\x0cThat fortune long ago allotted me.*\\nIf God adds the morrow we should accept it joyfully. The man who looks for the morrow\\nwithout worrying over it knows a peaceful independence and a happiness beyond all others.\\nWhoever has said „I have lived‟ receives a windfall every day he gets up in the morning.\\nBut I must close this letter now. „What!‟ you‟ll be saying. „Is it coming to me just as it is,\\nwithout any parting contribution?‟ Don‟t worry, it‟s bringing you something. Why did I call it\\n„something‟, though? It‟s a great deal. For what could be more splendid than the following\\nsaying which I‟m entrusting to this letter of mine for delivery to you: „To live under constraint is\\na misfortune, but there is no constraint to live under constraint.‟ Of course not, when on every\\nside there are plenty of short and easy roads to freedom there for the taking. Let us thank God\\nthat no one can be held a prisoner in life – the very constraints can be trampled under foot.\\n„It was Epicurus who said that,‟ you protest. „What business have you got with someone\\nelse‟s property?‟ Whatever is true is my property. And I shall persist in inflicting Epicurus on\\nyou, in order to bring it home to the people who take an oath of allegiance to someone and never\\nafterwards consider what is being said but only who said it, that the things of greatest merit are\\ncommon property.\\n\\nLETTER XV\\nOUR ancestors had a custom, observed right down as far as my own lifetime, of adding\\nto the opening words of a letter: „I trust this finds you as it leaves me, in good health.‟ We have\\ngood reason to say: „I trust this finds you in pursuit of wisdom.‟ For this is precisely what is\\nmeant by good health. Without wisdom the mind is sick, and the body itself, however physically\\npowerful, can only have the kind of strength that is found in persons in a demented or delirious\\nstate. So this is the sort of healthiness you must make your principal concern. You must attend to\\nthe other sort as well, but see that it takes second place. It won‟t cost you any great trouble if\\ngood health is all you want. For it is silly, my dear Lucilius, and no way for an educated man to\\nbehave, to spend one‟s time exercising the biceps, broadening the neck and shoulders and\\ndeveloping the lungs. Even when the extra feeding has produced gratifying results and you‟ve\\nput on a lot of muscle, you‟ll never match the strength or the weight of a prize ox. The greater\\nload, moreover, on the body is crushing to the spirit and renders it less active. So keep the body\\nwithin bounds as much as you can and make room for the spirit. Devotees of physical culture\\nhave to put up with a lot of nuisances. There are the exercises, in the first place, the toil involved\\nin which drains the vitality and renders it unfit for concentration or the more demanding sort of\\nstudies. Next there is the heavy feeding, which dulls mental acuteness. Then there is the taking\\non as coaches of the worst brand of slave, persons who divide their time between putting on\\nlotion and putting down liquor, whose idea of a well spent day consists of getting up a good\\nsweat and then replacing the fluid lost with plenty of drink, all the better to be absorbed on a dry\\nstomach. Drinking and perspiring – it‟s the life of a dyspeptic! There are short and simple\\nexercises which will tire the body without undue delay and save what needs especially close\\naccounting for, time. There is running, swinging weights about and jumping – either\\nhigh-jumping or long-jumping or the kind indulged in by the priests of Mars, if one may so\\ndescribe it, or to be rather more disrespectful, by the laundress. Pick out any of these for ease and\\nstraightforwardness. But whatever you do, return from body to mind very soon. Exercise it day\\nand night. Only a moderate amount of work is needed for it to thrive and develop. It is a form of\\nexercise to which cold and heat and even old age are no obstacle. Cultivate an asset which the\\npassing of time itself improves.\\n\\n\\x0cI‟m not telling you to be always bent over book or writing-tablets. The mind has to be\\ngiven some time off, but in such a way that it may be refreshed, not relaxed till it goes to pieces.\\nTravelling in one‟s carriage shakes the body up and doesn‟t interfere with intellectual pursuits;\\nyou can read, dictate, speak, or listen – nor does walking, for that matter, preclude any of these\\nactivities. Nor need you look down on voice-training, though I will not have you practising any\\nof this ascending and then descending again by degrees through set scales – if you start that,\\nyou‟ll be going on to take lessons in walking! Once let into your house the sort of person that\\nhunger teaches unheard-of occupations and you‟ll have someone regulating the way you walk\\nand watching the way you use your jaws as you eat, and in fact going just as far as your patience\\nand credulity lead his audacity on. Are you to conclude from what I‟ve just said that your voice\\nshould start its exercises with immediate shouting at full force? The natural thing is to lead up to\\nit through easy stages, so natural in fact that even persons involved in a quarrel begin in\\nconversational tones: only later do they go on to rend the air. No one makes an impassioned\\nappeal for „the help and support of all true men of Rome‟ at the very outset. …* Our purpose in\\nall this is not to give the voice, exercise, but to make it give us exercise.\\nI have relieved you, then, of no little bother. To these favours there shall be added the\\nfollowing small contribution, a striking maxim that comes from Greece. Here it is: „The life of\\nfolly is empty of gratitude, full of anxiety: it is focused wholly on the future.‟ „Who said that?‟\\nyou ask. The same man as before. And what sort of life do you think is meant by „the life of\\nfolly‟? Baba‟s and Isio‟s?† No, he means our own life, precipitated by blind desire into activities\\nthat are likely to bring us harm and will certainly never bring us satisfaction – if they could ever\\nsatisfy us they would have done so by now – never thinking how pleasant it is to ask for nothing,\\nhow splendid it is to be complete and be independent of fortune. So continually remind yourself,\\nLucilius, of the many things you have achieved. When you look at all the people out in front of\\nyou, think of all the ones behind you. If you want to feel appreciative where the gods and your\\nlife are concerned, just think how many people you‟ve outdone. Why be concerned about others,\\ncome to that, when you‟ve outdone your own self? Set yourself a limit which you couldn‟t even\\nexceed if you wanted to, and say good-bye at last to those deceptive prizes more precious to\\nthose who hope for them than to those who have won them. If there were anything substantial in\\nthem they would sooner or later bring a sense of fullness; as it is they simply aggravate the thirst\\nof those who swallow them. Away with pomp and show; as for the uncertain lot that the future\\nhas in store for me, why should I demand from fortune that she should give me this and that\\nrather than demand from myself that I should not ask for them? Why should I ask for them, after\\nall? Am I to pile them up in total forgetfulness of the frailty of human existence? What is the\\npurpose of my labours going to be? See, this day‟s my last – or maybe it isn‟t, but it‟s not so far\\naway from it.\\n\\nLETTER XVI\\nIT is clear to you, I know, Lucilius, that no one can lead a happy life, or even one that is\\nbearable, without the pursuit of wisdom, and that the perfection of wisdom is what makes the\\nhappy life, although even the beginnings of wisdom make life bearable. Yet this conviction, clear\\nas it is, needs to be strengthened and given deeper roots through daily reflection; making noble\\nresolutions is not as important as keeping the resolutions you have made already. You have to\\npersevere and fortify your pertinacity until the will to good becomes a disposition to good. So\\nyou needn‟t go in for all this long-winded protestation or say any more on the subject – I‟m well\\naware that you‟ve made a great deal of progress. I realize the feelings that prompt you to put\\n\\n\\x0cthese things in your letter, and there is no pretence or speciousness about them. But – to give you\\nmy honest opinion – at this stage, although I have great hopes of you, I do not yet feel quite\\nconfident about you. And I should like you to adopt the same attitude: you‟ve no grounds for\\nforming a ready, hasty belief in yourself. Carry out a searching analysis and close scrutiny of\\nyourself in all sorts of different lights. Consider above all else whether you‟ve advanced in\\nphilosophy or just in actual years.\\nPhilosophy is not an occupation of a popular nature, nor is it pursued for the sake of\\nself-advertisement. Its concern is not with words, but with facts. It is not carried on with the\\nobject of passing the day in an entertaining sort of way and taking the boredom out of leisure. It\\nmoulds and builds the personality, orders one‟s life, regulates one‟s conduct, shows one what\\none should do and what one should leave undone, sits at the helm, and keeps one on the correct\\ncourse as one is tossed about in perilous seas. Without it no one can lead a life free of fear or\\nworry. Every hour of the day countless situations arise that call for advice, and for that advice we\\nhave to look to philosophy.\\nSomeone may say: „What help can philosophy be to me if there is such a thing as fate?\\nWhat help can philosophy be if there is a deity controlling all? What help can it be if all is\\ngoverned by chance? For it is impossible either to change what is already determined or to make\\npreparations to meet what is undetermined; either, in the first case, my planning is forestalled by\\na God who decrees how I am to act, or, in the second case, it is fortune that allows me no\\nfreedom to plan.‟ Whichever of these alternatives, Lucilius, is true – even if all of them are true –\\nwe still need to practise philosophy. Whether we are caught in the grasp of an inexorable law of\\nfate, whether it is God who as lord of the universe has ordered all things, or whether the affairs\\nof mankind are tossed and buffeted haphazardly by chance, it is philosophy that has the duty of\\nprotecting us. She will encourage us to submit to God with cheerfulness and to fortune with\\ndefiance; she will show you how to follow God and bear what chance may send you. But I\\nmustn‟t pass on here to a discussion of the problem what is within our control if there is a\\ngoverning providence, whether we are carried along enmeshed in a train of fated happenings, or\\nwhether we are at the mercy of the sudden and the unforeseeable. For the present I go back to the\\npoint where I was before, to advise and urge you not to allow your spiritual enthusiasm to cool\\noff or fall away. Keep a hold on it and put it on a firm footing, so that what is at present an\\nenthusiasm may become a settled spiritual disposition.\\nIf I know you, you‟ll have been looking around from the very start of this letter to see\\nwhat it‟s going to bring you by way of a little present. Search the letter and you‟ll find it. You\\nneedn‟t think my kindness all that remarkable: I am only being generous, still, with someone\\nelse‟s property. Why, though, do I call it someone else‟s? Whatever is well said by anyone\\nbelongs to me. Here is another saying of Epicurus: „If you shape your life according to nature,\\nyou will never be poor; if according to people‟s opinions, you will never be rich.‟ Nature‟s wants\\nare small, while those of opinion are limitless. Imagine that you‟ve piled, up all that a veritable\\nhost of rich men ever possessed, that fortune has carried you far beyond the bounds of wealth so\\nfar as any private individual is concerned, building you a roof of gold and clothing you in royal\\npurple, conducting you to such a height of opulence and luxury that you hide the earth with\\nmarble floors – putting you in a position not merely to own, but to walk all over treasures –\\nthrow in sculptures, paintings, all that has been produced at tremendous pains by all the arts to\\nsatisfy extravagance: all these things will only induce in you a craving for even bigger things.\\nNatural desires are limited; those which spring from false opinions have nowhere to stop, for\\nfalsity has no point of termination. When a person is following a track, there is an eventual end\\n\\n\\x0cto it somewhere, but with wandering at large there is no limit. So give up pointless, empty\\njourneys, and whenever you want to know whether the desire aroused in you by something you\\nare pursuing is natural or quite unseeing, ask yourself whether it is capable of coming to rest at\\nany point; if after going a long way there is always something remaining farther away, be sure it\\nis not something natural.\\n\\nLETTER XVIII\\nIT is the month of December, and yet the whole city is in a sweat! Festivity at state\\nexpense is given unrestricted licence. Everywhere there echoes the noise of preparations on a\\nmassive scale. It all suggests that the Saturnalia* holidays are different from the ordinary\\nworking day, when the difference is really non-existent – so much so in fact that the man who\\nsaid that December used to be a month but is now a year was, in my opinion, not far wide of the\\nmark!\\nIf I had you with me I should enjoy consulting you and finding out what course you think\\nwe should follow: should we make no alteration in our daily habits, or should we take off our\\ntogas – time was when a change from formal wear would come about only during periods of\\ngrave political upheaval, whereas with us it happens for holidays‟ and pleasure‟s sake! – and\\nhave dinner parties with a note of gaiety about them, to avoid giving the impression that we\\ndisagree with the ways of those around us? If I know you as well as I think I do and you had to\\ngive a decision in the matter, you would say that we should be neither altogether like nor\\naltogether unlike the festive-hatted crowd. But perhaps this is the very season when we should be\\nkeeping the soul under strict control, making it unique in abstaining from pleasure just when the\\ncrowd are all on pleasure bent. If the soul succeeds in avoiding either heading or being carried\\naway in the direction of the temptations that lead people into extravagant living, no surer proof\\nof its strength of purpose can be vouchsafed it. Remaining dry and sober takes a good deal more\\nstrength of will when everyone about one is puking drunk; it takes a more developed sense of\\nfitness, on the other hand, not to make of oneself a person apart, to be neither indistinguishable\\nfrom those about one nor conspicuous by one‟s difference, to do the same things but not in quite\\nthe same manner. For a holiday can be celebrated without extravagant festivity.\\nStill, my determination to put your moral strength of purpose to the test is such that I\\npropose to give even you the following direction found in great men‟s teaching: set aside now\\nand then a number of days during which you will be content with the plainest of food, and very\\nlittle of it, and with rough, coarse clothing, and will ask yourself, „Is this what one used to\\ndread?‟ It is in times of security that the spirit should be preparing itself to deal with difficult\\ntimes; while fortune is bestowing favours on it then is the time for it to be strengthened against\\nher rebuffs. In the midst of peace the soldier carries out manoeuvres, throws up earthworks\\nagainst a non-existent enemy and tires himself out with unnecessary toil in order to be equal to it\\nwhen it is necessary. If you want a man to keep his head when the crisis comes you must give\\nhim some training before it comes. This was the aim of the men* who once every month\\npretended they were poor, bringing themselves face to face with want, to prevent their ever being\\nterrified by a situation which they had frequently rehearsed.\\nYou must not at this point imagine that I mean meals like Timon‟s or „the poor man‟s\\nroom‟ or anything else to which the extravagance of wealth resorts to amuse away its tedium.\\nThat pallet must be a real one, and the same applies to your smock, and your bread must be hard\\nand grimy. Endure all this for three or four days at a time, sometimes more, so that it is a genuine\\ntrial and not an amusement. At the end of it, believe me, Lucilius, you will revel in being sated\\n\\n\\x0cfor a penny, and will come to see that security from care is not dependent on fortune – for even\\nwhen she is angry she will always let us have what is enough for our needs.\\nThere is no reason, mind you, why you should suppose yourself to be performing a\\nconsiderable feat in doing this – you will only be doing something done by thousands upon\\nthousands of slaves and paupers. But take credit on one account, that you will be doing it of your\\nown free choice – and finding it no more difficult to endure on a permanent basis than to try out\\nonce in a while. We should be practising with a dummy target, getting to be at home with\\npoverty so that fortune cannot catch us unprepared. We shall be easier in our minds when rich if\\nwe have come to realize how far from burdensome it is to be poor. The great hedonist teacher\\nEpicurus used to observe certain periods during which he would be niggardly in satisfying his\\nhunger, with the object of seeing to what extent, if at all, one thereby fell short of attaining full\\nand complete pleasure, and whether it was worth going to much trouble to make the deficit good.\\nAt least so he says in the letter he wrote to Polyaenus in the year Charinus was in office. He\\nboasts in it indeed that he is managing to feed himself for less than a halfpenny whereas\\nMetrodorus, not yet having made such good progress, needs a whole halfpenny! Do you think\\nsuch fare can do no more than fill a person up? It can fill him with pleasure as well, and not the\\nkind of insubstantial, fleeting pleasure that needs constant renewal but a pleasure which is sure\\nand lasting. Barley porridge, or a crust of barley bread, and water do not make a very cheerful\\ndiet, but nothing gives one keener pleasure than the ability to derive pleasure even from that –\\nand the feeling of having arrived at something which one cannot be deprived of by any unjust\\nstroke of fortune. Prison rations are more generous: the man in the condemned cell is not so\\nscantily fed as that by the executioner; to reduce oneself, then, of one‟s own free choice to a diet\\nthat no man has any real call to be apprehensive about even if he is sentenced to death, that is an\\nact of real spiritual greatness. To do this is truly to forestall the blows of fortune. So, my dear\\nLucilius, start following these men‟s practice and appoint certain days on which to give up\\neverything and make yourself at home with next to nothing. Start cultivating a relationship with\\npoverty.\\nDear guest, be bold enough to pay no heed\\nTo riches, and so make yourself, like him,\\nWorthy of a god.*\\nFor no one is worthy of a god unless he has paid no heed to riches. I am not, mind you,\\nagainst your possessing them, but I want to ensure that you possess them without tremors; and\\nthis you will only achieve in one way, by convincing yourself that you can live a happy life even\\nwithout them, and by always regarding them as being on the point of vanishing.\\nBut it‟s time I started folding up this letter. „Not till you‟ve settled your account,‟ you\\nsay. Well, I‟ll refer you to Epicurus for payment. „Anger carried to excess begets madness.‟ How\\ntrue this is you‟re bound to know, having had both slaves and enemies. It is a passion, though,\\nwhich flares up against all types of people. It is born of love as well as hate, and is as liable to\\narise in the course of sport or jesting as in affairs of a serious kind. The factor that counts is not\\nthe importance of the cause from which it springs but the kind of personality it lands in, in the\\nsame way as with fire what matters is not the fierceness of the flame but where it catches – solid\\nobjects may resist the fiercest flame while, conversely, dry and inflammable matter will nurse a\\nmere spark into a conflagration. It is true, my dear Lucilius. The outcome of violent anger is a\\nmental raving, and therefore anger is to be avoided not for the sake of moderation but for the\\nsake of sanity.\\n\\nLETTER XXVI\\n\\n\\x0cIT‟s only a short time since I was telling you I was in sight of old age. Now I‟m afraid I\\nmay have left old age behind me altogether. Some other term would be more in keeping now\\nwith my years, or at least my present physical state, since old age connotes a period of decline,\\nnot debility. Put me in the list of the decrepit, the ones on the very brink! However, I\\ncongratulate myself, mind you, on the fact that my age has not, so far as I‟m aware, brought any\\ndeterioration in my spirit, conscious as I am of the deterioration in my constitution. Only my\\nvices and their accessories have decayed: the spirit is full of life, and delighted to be having only\\nlimited dealings with the body. It has thrown off a great part of its burden. It‟s full of vigour, and\\ncarrying on an argument with me on the subject of old age, maintaining that these are its finest\\nyears. Let‟s accept what it says, and let it make the most of its blessings. It tells me to start\\nthinking and examine how far I owe this serenity and sobriety to philosophy, and how far I owe\\nit simply to my years, and to investigate with some care what things I really am refusing to do\\nand what I‟m simply incapable of doing – and it‟s prepared to accept whatever I‟m really pleased\\nto find myself incapable of doing as equivalent to refusing to do them; and what cause can there\\nbe for complaint, after all, in anything that was always bound to come to an end fading gradually\\naway? What is troubling about that? „Nothing,‟ you may say, „could be more troubling than the\\nidea of our wasting and perishing away – melting out of existence, one may aptly call it, since we\\naren‟t struck down all of a sudden but worn away, every day that passes diminishing in some\\ndegree our powers.‟ Moving to one‟s end through nature‟s own gentle process of dissolution – is\\nthere a better way of leaving life than that? Not because there is anything wrong with a sudden,\\nviolent departure, but because this gradual withdrawal is an easy route.\\nAnyway, here‟s what I do: I imagine to myself that the testing time is drawing near, that\\nthe day that is going to see judgement pronounced on the whole of my past life has actually\\narrived, and I take a look at myself and address myself in these terms: „All that I‟ve done or said\\nup to now counts for nothing. My showing to date, besides being heavily varnished over, is of\\npaltry value and reliability as a guarantee of my spirit. I‟m going to leave it to death to settle\\nwhat progress I‟ve made. Without anxiety, then, I‟m making ready for the day when the tricks\\nand disguises will be put away and I shall come to a verdict on myself, determining whether the\\ncourageous attitudes I adopt are really felt or just so many words, and whether or not the defiant\\nchallenges I‟ve hurled at fortune have been mere pretence and pantomime. Away with the\\nworld‟s opinion of you – it‟s always unsettled and divided. Away with the pursuits that have\\noccupied the whole of your life – death is going to deliver the verdict in your case. Yes, all your\\ndebates and learned conferences, your scholarly talk and collection of maxims from the teachings\\nof philosophers, are in no way indicative of genuine spiritual strength. Bold words come even\\nfrom the timidest. It‟s only when you‟re breathing your last that the way you‟ve spent your time\\nwill become apparent. I accept the terms, and feel no dread of the coming judgement.‟ That‟s\\nwhat I say to myself, but assume that I‟ve said it to you as well. You‟re younger than I am, but\\nwhat difference does that make? No count is taken of years. Just where death is expecting you is\\nsomething we cannot know; so, for your part, expect him everywhere.\\nI was just intending to stop, my hand considering its closing sentence, but the accounts\\nhave still to be made out and this letter issued with its travelling expenses! You may assume that\\nI won‟t be announcing the source I intend borrowing from – you know whose funds I‟m drawing\\non! Give me a fraction more time and payment will be made out of my own pocket. In the\\nmeantime Epicurus will oblige me, with the following saying: „Rehearse death‟, or – the idea\\nmay come across to us rather more satisfactorily if put in this form – „It is a very good thing to\\n\\n\\x0cfamiliarize oneself with death.‟ You may possibly think it unnecessary to learn something which\\nyou will only have to put into practice once. That is the very reason why we ought to be\\npractising it. We must needs continually study a thing if we are not in a position to test whether\\nwe know it. „Rehearse death.‟ To say this is to tell a person to rehearse his freedom. A person\\nwho has learned how to die has unlearned how to be a slave. He is above, or at any rate beyond\\nthe reach of, all political powers. What are prisons, warders, bars to him? He has an open door.\\nThere is but one chain holding us in fetters, and that is our love of life. There is no need to cast\\nthis love out altogether, but it does need to be lessened somewhat so that, in the event of\\ncircumstances ever demanding this, nothing may stand in the way of our being prepared to do at\\nonce what we must do at some time or other.\\n\\nLETTER XXVII\\n„SO you‟re giving me advice, are you?‟ you say. „Have you already given yourself\\nadvice, then? Have you already put yourself straight? Is that how you come to have time for\\nreforming other people?‟ No, I‟m not so shameless as to set about treating people when I‟m sick\\nmyself. I‟m talking to you as if I were lying in the same hospital ward, about the illness we‟re\\nboth suffering from, and passing on some remedies. So listen to me as if I were speaking to\\nmyself. I‟m allowing you access to my inmost self, calling you in to advise me as I have things\\nout with myself. I proclaim to my own self: „Count your years and you‟ll be ashamed to be\\nwanting and working for exactly the same things as you wanted when you were a boy. Of this\\none thing make sure against your dying day – that your faults die before you do. Have done with\\nthose unsettled pleasures, which cost one dear – they do one harm after they‟re past and gone,\\nnot merely when they‟re in prospect. Even when they‟re over, pleasures of a depraved nature are\\napt to carry feelings of dissatisfaction, in the same way as a criminal‟s anxiety doesn‟t end with\\nthe commission of the crime, even if it‟s undetected at the time. Such pleasures are insubstantial\\nand unreliable; even if they don‟t do one any harm, they‟re fleeting in character. Look around for\\nsome enduring good instead. And nothing answers this description except what the spirit\\ndiscovers for itself within itself. A good character is the only guarantee of everlasting, carefree\\nhappiness. Even if some obstacle to this comes on the scene, its appearance is only to be\\ncompared to that of clouds which drift in front of the sun without ever defeating its light.‟\\nHow soon will you be fortunate enough to attain to this happiness? Well, you haven‟t\\nbeen dragging your steps up till now, but your pace could be increased. There‟s a lot of work\\nremaining to be done, and if you want to be successful you must devote all your waking hours\\nand all your efforts to the task personally. This is not something that admits of delegation. It is a\\ndifferent branch of learning which has room for devilling. There was a rich man called Calvisius\\nSabinus, in my own lifetime, who had a freedman‟s brains along with a freedman‟s fortune. I\\nhave never seen greater vulgarity in a successful man. His memory was so bad that at one\\nmoment or another the names of Ulysses, or Achilles, or Priam, characters he knew as well as we\\nknew our early teachers, would slip his memory. No doddering butler ever went through the\\nintroductions of a mass of callers committing quite such solecisms – not announcing people‟s\\nnames so much as foisting names on them – as Sabinus did with the Greek and Trojan heroes.\\nBut this didn‟t stop him wanting to appear a well-read man. And to this end he thought up the\\nfollowing short cut: he spent an enormous amount of money on slaves, one of them to know\\nHomer by heart, another to know Hesiod, while he assigned one apiece to each of the nine lyric\\npoets.* That the cost was enormous is hardly surprising: not having found what he wanted in the\\nmarket he had them made to order. After this collection of slaves had been procured for him, he\\n\\n\\x0cbegan to give his dinner guests nightmares. He would have these fellows at his elbow so that he\\ncould continually be turning to them for quotations from these poets which he might repeat to the\\ncompany, and then – it happened frequently – he would break down halfway through a word.\\nSatellius Quadratus, who regarded stupid millionaires as fair game to be sponged off, and\\nconsequently also fair game for flattery, as well as – and this goes with the other two things – fair\\ngame for facetiousness at their expense, suggested to him that he should keep a team of scholars\\n„to pick up the bits‟. On Sabinus‟ letting it be known that the slaves had set him back a hundred\\nthousand sesterces apiece, he said: „Yes, for less than that you could have bought the same\\nnumber of bookcases.‟ Sabinus was none the less quite convinced that what anyone in his\\nhousehold knew he knew personally. It was Satellius, again, who started urging Sabinus, a pale\\nand skinny individual whose health was poor, to take up wrestling.\\nWhen Sabinus retorted: „How can I possibly do that? It‟s as much as I can do to stay\\nalive‟, Satellius answered: „Now please, don‟t say that! Look how many slaves you‟ve got in\\nperfect physical condition!‟ A sound mind can neither be bought nor borrowed. And if it were\\nfor sale, I doubt whether it would find a buyer. And yet unsound ones are being purchased every\\nday.\\nBut let me pay you what I owe you and say goodbye. „Poverty brought into accord with\\nthe law of nature is wealth.‟ Epicurus is constantly saying this in one way or another. But\\nsomething that can never be learnt too thoroughly can never be said too often. With some people\\nyou only need to point to a remedy; others need to have it rammed into them.\\n\\nLETTER XXVIII\\nDO you think you are the only person to have had this experience? Are you really\\nsurprised, as if it were something unprecedented, that so long a tour and such diversity of scene\\nhave not enabled you to throw off this melancholy and this feeling of depression? A change of\\ncharacter, not a change of air, is what you need. Though you cross the boundless ocean, though,\\nto use the words of our poet Virgil,\\nLands and towns are left astern,*\\nwhatever your destination you will be followed by your failings. Here is what Socrates\\nsaid to someone who was making the same complaint: „How can you wonder your travels do you\\nno good, when you carry yourself around with you? You are saddled with the very thing that\\ndrove you away.‟ How can novelty of surroundings abroad and becoming acquainted with\\nforeign scenes or cities be of any help? All that dashing about turns out to be quite futile. And if\\nyou want to know why all this running away cannot help you, the answer is simply this: you are\\nrunning away in your own company. You have to lay aside the load on your spirit. Until you do\\nthat, nowhere will satisfy you. Imagine your present state as being like that of the prophetess\\nwhom our Virgil represents in a roused and excited state, largely taken over by a spirit not her\\nown:\\nThe Sibyl raves about as one possessed,\\nIn hopes she may dislodge the mighty god\\nWithin her bosom.*\\nYou rush hither and thither with the idea of dislodging a firmly seated weight when the\\nvery dashing about just adds to the trouble it causes you – like the cargo in a ship, which does\\nnot weigh her down unduly so long as it does not shift, but if it rolls more to one side than the\\nother it is liable to carry the side on which it settles down into the water. Whatever you do is bad\\nfor you, the very movement in itself being harmful to you since you are in fact shaking up a sick\\n\\n\\x0cman.\\nOnce you have rid yourself of the affliction there, though, every change of scene will\\nbecome a pleasure. You may be banished to the ends of the earth, and yet in whatever outlandish\\ncorner of the world you may find yourself stationed, you will find that place, whatever it may be\\nlike, a hospitable home. Where you arrive does not matter so much as what sort of person you\\nare when you arrive there. We ought not, therefore, to give over our hearts for good to any one\\npart of the world. We should live with the conviction: „I wasn‟t born for one particular corner:\\nthe whole world‟s my home country.‟ If the truth of that were clear to you, you would not be\\nsurprised that the diversity of new surroundings for which, out of weariness of the old, you are\\nconstantly heading fails to do you any good. Whichever you first came to would have satisfied\\nyou if you had believed you were at home in all. As it is, instead of travelling you are rambling\\nand drifting, exchanging one place for another when the thing you are looking for, the good life,\\nis available everywhere.\\nCould there be a scene of greater turmoil than the City? Yet even there, if need be, you\\nare free to lead a life of peace. Given a free choice of posting, though, I should flee a long way\\nfrom the vicinity, let alone the sight of the City. For in the same way as there are unpleasant\\nclimates which are trying even to the most robust constitutions, there are others which are none\\ntoo wholesome for the mind, even though it be a sound one, when it is still in an imperfect state\\nand building up its strength. I do not agree with those who recommend a stormy life and plunge\\nstraight into the breakers, waging a spirited struggle against wordly obstacles every day of their\\nlives. The wise man will put up with these things, not go out of his way to meet them; he will\\nprefer a state of peace to a state of war. It does not profit a man much to have managed to discard\\nhis own failings if he must ever be at loggerheads with other people‟s. „Socrates,‟ they will tell\\nyou, „had the Thirty Tyrants standing over him and yet they could not break his spirit.‟ What\\ndifference does it make how many masters a man has? Slavery is only one, and yet the person\\nwho refuses to let the thought of it affect him is a free man no matter how great the swarm of\\nmasters around him.\\nIt is time I left off – not before I have paid the usual duty, though! „A consciousness of\\nwrongdoing is the first step to salvation.‟ This remark of Epicurus‟ is to me a very good one. For\\na person who is not aware that he is doing anything wrong has no desire to be put right. You\\nhave to catch yourself doing it before you can reform. Some people boast about their failings:\\ncan you imagine someone who counts his faults as merits ever giving thought to their cure? So –\\nto the best of your ability – demonstrate your own guilt, conduct inquiries of your own into all\\nthe evidence against yourself. Play the part first of prosecutor, then of judge and finally of\\npleader in mitigation. Be harsh with yourself at times.\\n\\nLETTER XXXIII\\nYou feel that my present letters should be like my earlier ones and have odd sayings of\\nleading Stoics appended to them. But they never busied themselves with philosophical gems.\\nTheir whole system is too virile for that. When things stand out and attract attention in a work\\nyou can be sure there is an uneven quality about it. One tree by itself never calls for admiration\\nwhen the whole forest rises to the same height. Poetry is replete with such things; so is history.\\nSo please don‟t think them peculiar to Epicurus; they are general, and ours more than anyone‟s,\\nalthough they receive more notice in him because they occur at widely scattered intervals,\\nbecause they are unlooked for, and because it is rather a surprise to find spirited sayings in a\\nperson who – so most people consider – was an advocate of soft living. In my own view,\\n\\n\\x0cEpicurus was actually, in spite of his long sleeves, a man of spirit as well. Courage, energy and a\\nwarlike spirit are as commonly given to Persians as to people with a style of dress more suited to\\naction.\\nSo there‟s no call for you to press for stock excerpts, seeing that the sort of thing which in\\nthe case of other thinkers is excerpted is in our case continuous writing. That‟s why we don‟t go\\nin for that business of window-dressing; we don‟t mislead the customer, so that when he enters\\nthe shop he finds nothing in stock apart from the things on display in the window. We allow him\\nto pick up samples from wherever he likes. And suppose we did want to separate out individual\\naphorisms from the mass, whom should we attribute them to? Zeno? Cleanthes? Chrysippus?\\nPanaetius? Posidonius? We Stoics are no monarch‟s subjects; each asserts his own freedom.\\nAmong Epicureans whatever Hermarchus or Metrodorus says is credited to one man alone;\\neverything ever said by any member of that fraternity was uttered under the authority and\\nauspices of one person. I say again, then, that for us, try as we may, it is impossible to pick out\\nindividual items from so vast a stock in which each thing is as good as the next.\\nThe poor man ‟tis that counts his flock.*\\nWherever you look your eye will light on things that might stand out if everything around\\nthem were not of equal standard.\\nSo give up this hope of being able to get an idea of the genius of the greatest figures by so\\ncursory an approach. You have to examine and consider it as a whole. There is a sequence about\\nthe creative process, and a work of genius is a synthesis of its individual features from which\\nnothing can be subtracted without disaster. I have no objection to your inspecting the\\ncomponents individually provided you do so without detaching them from the personality they\\nactually belong to; a woman is not beautiful when her ankle or arm wins compliments, but when\\nher total appearance diverts admiration from the individual parts of her body.\\nStill, if you press me I won‟t treat you so meanly – openhanded generosity it shall be.\\nThere is a mass of such things, an enormous mass of them, lying all over the place, needing only\\nto be picked up as distinct from gathered up. They come, not in dribs and drabs, but in a closely\\ninterconnected and continuous stream. I have no doubt, too, they may be very helpful to the\\nuninitiated and those who are still novices, for individual aphorisms in a small compass, rounded\\noff in units rather like lines of verse, become fixed more readily in the mind. It is for this reason\\nthat we give children proverbs and what the Greeks call chriae* to learn by heart, a child‟s mind\\nbeing able to take these in at a stage when anything more would be beyond its capacity. But in\\nthe case of a grown man who has made incontestable progress it is disgraceful to go hunting after\\ngems of wisdom, and prop himself up with a minute number of the best-known sayings, and be\\ndependent on his memory as well; it is time he was standing on his own feet. He should be\\ndelivering himself of such sayings, not memorizing them. It is disgraceful that a man who is old\\nor in sight of old age should have a wisdom deriving solely from his notebook. „Zeno said this.‟\\nAnd what have you said? „Cleanthes said that.‟ What have you said? How much longer are you\\ngoing to serve under others‟ orders? Assume authority yourself and utter something that may be\\nhanded down to posterity. Produce something from your own resources.\\nThis is why I look on people like this as a spiritless lot – the people who are forever\\nacting as interpreters and never as creators, always lurking in someone else‟s shadow. They\\nnever venture to do for themselves the things they have spent such a long time learning. They\\nexercise their memories on things that are not their own. It is one thing, however, to remember,\\nanother to know. To remember is to safeguard something entrusted to your memory, whereas to\\nknow, by contrast, is actually to make each item your own, and not to be dependent on some\\n\\n\\x0coriginal and be constantly looking to see what the master said. „Zeno said this, Cleanthes that.‟\\nLet‟s have some difference between you and the books! How much longer are you going to be a\\npupil? From now on do some teaching as well. Why, after all, should I listen to what I can read\\nfor myself? „The living voice,‟ it may be answered, „counts for a great deal.‟ Not when it is just\\nacting in a kind of secretarial capacity, making itself an instrument for what others have to say.\\nA further point, too, is that these people who never attain independence follow the views\\nof their predecessors, first, in matters in which everyone else without exception has abandoned\\nthe older authority concerned, and secondly, in matters in which investigations are still not\\ncomplete. But no new findings will ever be made if we rest content with the findings of the past.\\nBesides, a man who follows someone else not only does not find anything, he is not even\\nlooking. „But surely you are going to walk in your predecessors‟ footsteps?‟ Yes indeed, I shall\\nuse the old road, but if I find a shorter and easier one I shall open it up. The men who poineered\\nthe old routes are leaders, not our masters. Truth lies open to everyone. There has yet to be a\\nmonopoly of truth. And there is plenty of it left for future generations too.\\n\\nLETTER XXXVIII\\nYou are quite right in urging that we should exchange letters oftener. The utmost benefit\\ncomes from talk because it steals little by little into the mind. Lectures prepared beforehand and\\ndelivered before a listening audience are more resounding but less intimate. Philosophy is good\\nadvice, and no one gives advice at the top of his voice. Such harangues, if I may call them that,\\nmay need to be resorted to now and then where a person in a state of indecision is needing a\\npush. But when the object is not to make him want to learn but to get him learning, one must\\nhave recourse to these lower tones, which enter the mind more easily and stick in it. What is\\nrequired is not a lot of words but effectual ones.\\nWords need to be sown like seed. No matter how tiny a seed may be, when it lands in the\\nright sort of ground it unfolds its strength and from being minute expands and grows to a\\nmassive size. Reason does the same; to the outward eye its dimensions may be insignificant, but\\nwith activity it starts developing. Although the words spoken are few, if the mind has taken them\\nin as it should they gather strength and shoot upwards. Yes, precepts have the same features as\\nseeds: they are of compact dimensions and they produce impressive results – given, as I say, the\\nright sort of mind, to grasp at and assimilate them. The mind will then respond by being in its\\nturn creative and will produce a yield exceeding what was put into it.\\n\\nLETTER XL\\nTHANK you for writing so often. By doing so you give me a glimpse of yourself in the\\nonly way you can. I never get a letter from you without instantly feeling we‟re together. If\\npictures of absent friends are a source of pleasure to us, refreshing the memory and relieving the\\nsense of void with a solace however insubstantial and unreal, how much more so are letters,\\nwhich carry marks and signs of the absent friend that are real. For the handwriting of a friend\\naffords us what is so delightful about seeing him again, the sense of recognition.\\nYou say in your letter that you went and heard the philosopher Serapio when his ship put\\nin where you are. „His words,‟ you say, „tend to be tumbled out at a tremendous pace, pounded\\nand driven along rather than poured out, for they come in a volume no one voice could cope\\nwith.‟ I do not approve of this in a philosopher, whose delivery – like his life – should be\\nwell-ordered; nothing can be well-regulated if it is done in a breakneck hurry. That is why in\\nHomer the impetuous type of eloquence which he compares to snow that keeps on coming down\\n\\n\\x0cwithout a break, is given to the orator, while from the old man there comes a gentle eloquence\\nthat „flowed sweeter than honey‟.* You should take the view, then, that this copious and\\nimpetuous energy in a speaker is better suited to a hawker than to someone who deals with a\\nsubject of serious importance and is also a teacher.\\nYet I am just as much against his words coming in a trickle as in a stream. He should not\\nkeep people‟s ears on the stretch any more than he should swamp them. For the other extreme of\\nthinness and poverty means less attentiveness on the part of the listener as he becomes tired of\\nthis slowness with all its interruptions. Nonetheless what is waited for does sink in more readily\\nthan what goes flying past; one speaks in any event of instruction as being handed on to those\\nbeing taught, and something that escapes them is hardly being handed on.\\nLanguage, moreover, which devotes its attention to truth ought to be plain and\\nunadorned. This popular style has nothing to do with truth. Its object is to sway a mass audience,\\nto carry away unpractised ears by the force of its onslaught. It never submits itself to detailed\\ndiscussion, is just wafted away. Besides, how can a thing possibly govern others when it cannot\\nbe governed itself? And apart from all this surely language which is directed to the healing of\\nmen‟s minds needs to penetrate into one? Medicines do no good unless they stop some length of\\ntime in one. There is, moreover, a great deal of futility and emptiness about this style of\\nspeaking, which has more noise about it than effectiveness. There are my terrors to be quieted,\\nincitements to be quelled, illusions to be dispelled, extravagance to be checked, greed to be\\nreprimanded: which of these things can be done in a hurry? What doctor can heal patients merely\\nin passing? One might add, too, that there is not even any pleasure to be found in such a noisy\\npromiscuous torrent of words. Just as with a lot of things that one would never believe possible\\none finds it quite enough to have seen them once proved possible, so with these performers with\\nwords, to have heard them once is more than enough. What is there in them, after all, that anyone\\ncould want to learn or imitate? What view is one likely to take of the state of a person‟s mind\\nwhen his speech is wild and incoherent and knows no restraint?\\nThis rapidity of utterance recalls a person running down a slope and unable to stop where\\nhe meant to, being carried on instead a lot farther than he intended, at the mercy of his body‟s\\nmomentum; it is out of control, and unbecoming to philosophy, which should be placing her\\nwords, not throwing them around, and moving forward step by step. „But surely she can move on\\nto a higher plane now and then as well?‟ Certainly, but it must be without prejudice to her\\ndignity of character, and this vehement, excessive energy strips her of that. Power she should\\nhave, great power, but it should be controlled: she should be a never-failing stream, not a spate.\\nEven in an advocate I should be loth to allow such uncontrollable speed in delivery, all in an\\nunruly rush; how could a judge (who is not uncommonly, too, inexperienced and unqualified) be\\nexpected to keep up with it? Even on the occasions when an advocate is carried away by an\\nungovernable passion or a desire to display his powers, he should not increase his pace and pile\\non the words beyond the capacity of the ear.\\nYou will be doing the right thing, therefore, if you do not go to listen to people who are\\nmore concerned about the quantity than the quality of what they say, and choose yourself – if\\nyou have to – to speak in the manner of Publius Vinicius. When Asellius was asked how\\nVinicius spoke, he described it as being. „at a slow pace‟. Geminus Varius in fact remarked,\\n„How you can call the man eloquent I simply don‟t know – he can‟t string three words together.‟\\nIs there any reason why of the two you should not choose Vinicius‟ style? You can expect to be\\ninterrupted by persons with as little taste as the one who, when Vinicius was jerking the words\\nout one by one, as if he were dictating rather than speaking, exclaimed, „I call on the speaker to\\n\\n\\x0cspeak.‟ The pace of Quintus Haterius, a celebrated speaker of his day, is something I should have\\na sensible man keep well clear of: with him there was never a hesitation or a pause, only one start\\nand only one stop.\\nBut I also think that certain styles are suitable in a greater or lesser degree to different\\nnationalities. In a Greek one will tolerate this lack of discipline, while we have acquired the habit\\nof punctuating what we say, in writing as well as speech. Our own Cicero, too, from whom\\nRoman oratory really sprang, was a steady goer. Roman discourse is more given to\\nself-examination, appraising itself and inviting appraisal. Fabianus, who added outstanding\\noratory to those more important distinctions of his, his way of life and his learning, would\\ndiscuss a subject with dispatch rather than with haste. You might describe his oratory as being\\nnot rapid but fluent. This I am ready to see in a philosopher, but I do not insist on it; his delivery\\nis not to be halting, but I should rather have the words issued forth than flowing forth. And a\\nfurther reason I have for warning you against that disease is the fact that you can only acquire it\\nsuccessfully if you cease to feel any sense of shame. You really need to give the skin of your\\nface a good rub and then not listen to yourself! For that unguarded pace will give rise to a lot of\\nexpressions of which you would otherwise be critical. You cannot, I repeat, successfully acquire\\nit and preserve your modesty at the same time. One needs, moreover, constant daily practice for\\nit. It requires a switch of attention, too, from subject-matter to words. And even if it does\\ntranspire that the words come readily to the tongue and are capable of reeling off it without any\\neffort on your part, they will still need to be regulated. A way of speaking which is restrained,\\nnot bold, suits a wise man in the same way as an unassuming sort of walk does. The upshot, then,\\nof what I have to say is this: I am telling you to be a slow-speaking person.\\n\\nLETTER XLI\\nYOU are doing the finest possible thing and acting in your best interests if, as you say in\\nyour letter, you are persevering in your efforts to acquire a sound understanding. This is\\nsomething it is foolish to pray for when you can win it from your own self. There is no need to\\nraise our hands to heaven; there is no need to implore the temple warden to allow us close to the\\near of some graven image, as though this increased the chances of our being heard. God is near\\nyou, is with you, is inside you. Yes, Lucilius, there resides within us a divine spirit, which guards\\nus and watches us in the evil and the good we do. As we treat him, so will he treat us. No man,\\nindeed, is good without God – is any one capable of rising above fortune unless he has help from\\nGod? He it is that prompts us to noble and exalted endeavours. In each and every good man\\nA god (what god we are uncertain) dwells.*\\nIf you have ever come on a dense wood of ancient trees that have risen to an exceptional\\nheight, shutting out all sight of the sky with one thick screen of branches upon another, the\\nloftiness of the forest, the seclusion of the spot, your sense of wonderment at finding so deep and\\nunbroken a gloom out of doors, will persuade you of the presence of a deity. Any cave in which\\nthe rocks have been eroded deep into the mountain resting on it, its hollowing out into a cavern\\nof impressive extent not produced by the labours of men but the result of processes of nature,\\nwill strike into your soul some kind of inkling of the divine. We venerate the sources of\\nimportant streams; places where a mighty river bursts suddenly from hiding are provided with\\naltars; hot springs are objects of worship; the darkness or unfathomable depth of pools has made\\ntheir waters sacred. And if you come across a man who is never alarmed by dangers, never\\naffected by cravings, happy in adversity, calm in the midst of storm, viewing mankind from a\\nhigher level and the gods from their own, is it not likely that a feeling will find its way into you\\n\\n\\x0cof veneration for him? Is it not likely that you will say to yourself, „Here is a thing which is too\\ngreat, too sublime for anyone to regard it as being in the same sort of category as that puny body\\nit inhabits.‟ Into that body there has descended a divine power. The soul that is elevated and well\\nregulated, that passes through any experience as if it counted for comparatively little, that smiles\\nat all the things we fear or pray for, is impelled by a force that comes from heaven. A thing of\\nthat soul‟s height cannot stand without the prop of a deity. Hence the greater part of it is situated\\nwhere it descends from; in the same way as the sun‟s rays touch the earth but are really situated\\nat the point from which they emanate, a soul possessed of greatness and holiness, which has been\\nsent down into this world in order that we may gain a nearer knowledge of the divine, associates\\nwith us, certainly, but never loses contact with its source. On that source it depends; that is the\\ndirection in which its eyes turn, and the direction it strives to climb in; the manner in which it\\ntakes part in our affairs is that of a superior being.\\nWhat, then, is this soul? Something which has a lustre that is due to no quality other than\\nits own. Could anything be more stupid than to praise a person for something that is not his? Or\\nmore crazy than admiring things which in a single moment can be transferred to another? It is\\nnot a golden bit that makes one horse superior to others. Sending a lion into the arena with his\\nmane gilded, tired by the handling he has been given in the process of being forced to submit to\\nthis embellishment, is a very different thing from sending in a wild one with his spirit unbroken.\\nBold in attack, as nature meant him to be, in all his unkempt beauty, a beast whose glory it is that\\nnone can look on him without fear, he stands higher in people‟s eyes than the other, docile,\\ngold-leaf coated creature.\\nNo one should feel pride in anything that is not his own. We praise a vine if it loads its\\nbranches with fruit and bends its very props to the ground with the weight it carries: would any\\none prefer the famous vine that had gold grapes and leaves hanging on it? Fruitfulness is the\\nvine‟s peculiar virtue. So, too, in a man praise is due only to what is his very own. Suppose he\\nhas a beautiful home and a handsome collection of servants, a lot of land under cultivation and a\\nlot of money out at interest; not one of these things can be said to be in him – they are just things\\naround him. Praise in him what can neither be given nor snatched away, what is peculiarly a\\nman‟s.\\nYou ask what that is? It is his spirit, and the perfection of his reason in that spirit. For\\nman is a rational animal. Man‟s ideal state is realized when he has fulfilled the purpose for which\\nhe was born. And what is it that reason demands of him? Something very easy – that he live in\\naccordance with his own nature. Yet this is turned into something difficult by the madness that is\\nuniversal among men; we push one another into vices. And how can people be called back to\\nspiritual well-being when no one is trying to hold them back and the crowd is urging them on?\\n\\nLETTER XLVI\\nTHE book you promised me has come. I was intending to read it at my convenience and I\\nopened it on arrival without meaning to do any more than just get an idea of its contents. The\\nnext thing I knew the book itself had charmed me into a deeper reading of it there and then. How\\nlucid its style is you may gather from the fact that I found the work light reading, although a first\\nglance might well convey the impression that the writer was someone like Livy or Epicurus, its\\nbulk being rather unlike you or me! It was so enjoyable, though, that I found myself held and\\ndrawn on until I ended up having read it right through to the end without a break. All the time the\\nsunshine was inviting me out, hunger prompting me to eat, the weather threatening to break, but\\nI gulped it all down in one sitting.\\n\\n\\x0cIt was a joy, not just a pleasure, to read it. There was so much talent and spirit about it –\\nI‟d have said „forcefulness‟, too, if it had been written on a quieter plane now and then and\\nperiodically raised on to a higher one; as it was there was no such forcefulness, but instead there\\nwas a sustained evenness of style. The writing was pure and virile – and yet not lacking in that\\noccasional entertaining touch, that bit of light relief at the appropriate moment. The quality of\\nnobility, of sublimity, you have; I want you to keep it, and to carry on just the way you‟re doing.\\nYour subject, also, contributed to the result – which is a reason why you should always\\nselect a fertile one, one that will engage the mind‟s attention and stimulate it. But I‟ll write and\\nsay more about the book when I‟ve gone over it again. At the moment my judgement isn‟t really\\na sufficiently settled one – it‟s as if I‟d heard it all rather than read it. You must let me go into it\\nthoroughly, too. You needn‟t be apprehensive, you‟ll hear nothing but the truth. How fortunate\\nyou are in possessing nothing capable of inducing anyone to tell you a lie over a distance as great\\nas the one that separates us – except that even in these circumstances, when all reason for it is\\nremoved, we still find habit a reason for telling lies!\\n\\nLETTER XLVII\\nI‟M glad to hear, from these people who‟ve been visiting you, that you live on friendly\\nterms with your slaves. It is just what one expects of an enlightened, cultivated person like\\nyourself. „They‟re slaves,‟ people say. No. They‟re human beings. „They‟re slaves.‟ But they\\nshare the same roof as ourselves. „They‟re slaves.‟ No, they‟re friends, humble friends. „They‟re\\nslaves.‟ Strictly speaking they‟re our fellow-slaves, if you once reflect that fortune has as much\\npower over us as over them.\\nThis is why I laugh at those people who think it degrading for a man to eat with his slave.\\nWhy do they think it degrading? Only because the most arrogant of conventions has decreed that\\nthe master of the house be surrounded at his dinner by a crowd of slaves, who have to stand\\naround while he eats more than he can hold, loading an already distended belly in his monstrous\\ngreed until it proves incapable any longer of performing the function of a belly, at which point he\\nexpends more effort in vomiting everything up than he did in forcing it down. And all this time\\nthe poor slaves are forbidden to move their lips to speak, let alone to eat. The slightest murmur is\\nchecked with a stick; not even accidental sounds like a cough, or a sneeze, or a hiccup are let off\\na beating. All night long they go on standing about, dumb and hungry, paying grievously for any\\ninterruption.\\nThe result is that slaves who cannot talk before his face talk about him behind his back.\\nThe slaves of former days, however, whose mouths were not sealed up like this, who were able\\nto make conversation not only in the presence of their master but actually with him, were ready\\nto bare their necks to the executioner for him, to divert on to themselves any danger that\\nthreatened him; they talked at dinner but under torture they kept their mouths shut. It is just this\\nhighhanded treatment which is responsible for the frequently heard saying, „You‟ve as many\\nenemies as you‟ve slaves.‟ They are not our enemies when we acquire them; we make them so.\\nFor the moment I pass over other instances of our harsh and inhuman behaviour, the way\\nwe abuse them as if they were beasts of burden instead of human beings, the way for example,\\nfrom the time we take our places on the dinner couches, one of them mops up the spittle and\\nanother stationed at the foot of the couch collects up the „leavings‟ of the drunken diners.\\nAnother carves the costly game birds, slicing off choice pieces from the breast and rump with the\\nunerring strokes of a trained hand – unhappy man, to exist for the one and only purpose of\\ncarving a fat bird in the proper style – although the person who learns the technique from sheer\\n\\n\\x0cnecessity is not quite so much to be pitied as the person who gives demonstrations of it for\\npleasure‟s sake. Another, the one who serves the wine, is got up like a girl and engaged in a\\nstruggle with his years; he cannot get away from his boyhood, but is dragged back to it all the\\ntime; although he already has the figure of a soldier, he is kept free of hair by having it rubbed\\naway or pulled out by the roots. His sleepless night is divided between his master‟s drunkenness\\nand sexual pleasures, boy at the table, man in the bedroom. Another, who has the privilege of\\nrating each guest‟s character, has to go on standing where he is, poor fellow, and watch to see\\nwhose powers of flattery and absence of restraint in appetite or speech are to secure them an\\ninvitation for the following day. Add to these the caterers with their highly developed knowledge\\nof their master‟s palate, the men who know the flavours that will sharpen his appetite, know what\\nwill appeal to his eyes, what novelties can tempt his stomach when it is becoming queasy, what\\ndishes he will push aside with the eventual coming of sheer satiety, what he will have a craving\\nfor on that particular day.\\nThese are the people with whom a master cannot tolerate the thought of taking his dinner,\\nassuming that to sit down at the same table with one of his slaves would seriously impair his\\ndignity. „The very idea!‟ he says. Yet have a look at the number of masters he has from the ranks\\nof these very slaves.* Take Callistus‟ one-time master. I saw him once actually standing waiting\\nat Callistus‟ door and refused admission while others were going inside, the very master who had\\nattached a price-ticket to the man and put him up for sale along with other rejects from his\\nhousehold staff. There‟s a slave who has paid his master back – one who was pushed into the\\nfirst lot, too, the batch on which the auctioneer is merely trying out his voice! Now it was the\\nslave‟s turn to strike his master off his list, to decide that he‟s not the sort of person he wants in\\nhis house. Callistus‟ master sold him, yes, and look how much it cost him!\\nHow about reflecting that the person you call your slave traces his origin back to the\\nsame stock as yourself, has the same good sky above him, breathes as you do, lives as you do,\\ndies as you do? It is as easy for you to see in him a free-born man as for him to see a slave in\\nyou. Remember the Varus disaster: many a man of the most distinguished ancestry, who was\\ndoing his military service as the first step on the road to a seat in the Senate, was brought low by\\nfortune, condemned by her to look after a steading, for example, or a flock of sheep. Now think\\ncontemptuously of these people‟s lot in life, in whose very place, for all your contempt, you\\ncould suddenly find yourself.\\nI don‟t want to involve myself in an endless topic of debate by discussing the treatment of\\nslaves, towards whom we Romans are exceptionally arrogant, harsh and insulting. But the\\nessence of the advice I‟d like to give is this: treat your inferiors in the way in which you would\\nlike to be treated by your own superiors. And whenever it strikes you how much power you have\\nover your slave, let it also strike you that your own master has just as much power over you. „I\\nhaven‟t got a master,‟ you say. You‟re young yet; there‟s always the chance that you‟ll have one.\\nHave you forgotten the age at which Hecuba became a slave, or Croesus, or the mother of\\nDarius, or Plato, or Diogenes? Be kind and courteous in your dealings with a slave; bring him\\ninto your discussions and conversations and your company generally. And if at this point all\\nthose people who have been spoilt by luxury raise an outcry protesting, as they will, „There\\ncouldn‟t be anything more degrading, anything more disgraceful‟, let me just say that these are\\nthe very persons I will catch on occasion kissing the hand of someone else‟s slave.\\nDon‟t you notice, too, how our ancestors took away all odium from the master‟s position\\nand all that seemed insulting or degrading in the lot of the slave by calling the master „father of\\nthe household‟ and speaking of the slaves as „members of the household‟ (something which\\n\\n\\x0csurvives to this day in the mime)? They instituted, too, a holiday on which master and slave were\\nto eat together, not as the only day this could happen, of course, but as one on which it was\\nalways to happen. And in the household they allowed the slaves to hold official positions and to\\nexercise some jurisdiction in it; in fact they regarded the household as a miniature republic.\\n„Do you mean to say,‟ comes the retort, „that I‟m to have each and every one of my\\nslaves sitting at the table with me?‟ Not at all, any more than you‟re to invite to it everybody who\\nisn‟t a slave. You‟re quite mistaken, though, if you imagine that I‟d bar from the table certain\\nslaves on the grounds of the relatively menial or dirty nature of their work – that muleteer, for\\nexample, or that cowhand. I propose to value them according to their character, not their jobs.\\nEach man has a character of his own choosing; it is chance or fate that decides his choice of job.\\nHave some of them dine with you because they deserve it, others in order to make them so\\ndeserving. For if there‟s anything typical of the slave about them as a result of the low company\\nthey‟re used to living in, it will be rubbed off through association with men of better breeding.\\nYou needn‟t, my dear Lucilius, look for friends only in the City or the Senate; if you keep\\nyour eyes open, you‟ll find them in your own home. Good material often lies idle for want of\\nsomeone to make use of it; just give it a trial. A man who examines the saddle and bridle and not\\nthe animal itself when he is out to buy a horse is a fool; similarly, only an absolute fool values a\\nman according to his clothes, or according to his social position, which after all is only\\nsomething that we wear like clothing.\\n„He‟s a slave.‟ But he may have the spirit of a free man. „He‟s a slave.‟ But is that really\\nto count against him? Show me a man who isn‟t a slave; one is a slave to sex, another to money,\\nanother to ambition; all are slaves to hope or fear. I could show you a man who has been a\\nConsul who is a slave to his „little old woman‟, a millionaire who is the slave of a little girl in\\ndomestic service. I could show you some highly aristocratic young men who are utter slaves to\\nstage artistes. And there‟s no state of slavery more disgraceful than one which is self-imposed.\\nSo you needn‟t allow yourself to be deterred by the snobbish people I‟ve been talking about from\\nshowing good humour towards your slaves instead of adopting an attitude of arrogant superiority\\ntowards them. Have them respect you rather than fear you.\\nHere, just because I‟ve said they „should respect a master rather than fear him‟, someone\\nwill tell us that I‟m now inviting slaves to proclaim their freedom and bringing about their\\nemployers‟ overthrow. „Are slaves to pay their “respects” like dependent followers or early\\nmorning callers? That‟s what he means, I suppose.‟ Anyone saying this forgets that what is\\nenough for a god, in the shape of worship, cannot be too little for a master. To be really respected\\nis to be loved; and love and fear will not mix. That‟s why I think you‟re absolutely right in not\\nwishing to be feared by your slaves, and in confining your lashings to verbal ones; as instruments\\nof correction, beatings are for animals only. Besides, what annoys us does not necessarily do us\\nany harm; but we masters are apt to be robbed of our senses by mere passing fancies, to the point\\nwhere our anger is called out by anything which fails to answer to our will. We assume the\\nmental attitudes of tyrants. For they too forget their own strength and the helplessness of others\\nand grow white-hot with fury as if they had received an injury, when all the time they are quite\\nimmune from any such danger through the sheer exaltedness of their position. Nor indeed are\\nthey unaware of this; but it does not stop them seizing an opportunity of finding fault with an\\ninferior and maltreating him for it; they receive an injury by way of excuse to do one themselves.\\nBut I won‟t keep you any longer; you don‟t need exhortation. It is a mark of a good way\\nof life that, among other things, it satisfies and abides; bad behaviour, constantly changing, not\\nfor the better, simply into different forms, has none of this stability.\\n\\n\\x0cLETTER XLVIII\\nI SHALL reply later to the letter you sent me while you were on your journey – it was as\\nlong as the journey itself! I must first take myself aside and deliberate what advice I should give.\\nFor you yourself, before consulting me as you are doing, gave long thought to the question\\nwhether you should consult me at all, so I ought to be giving this question of advice far longer\\nthought, on the principle that it takes you more time to solve a problem than to set it. Particularly\\nwhen one course is to your interest and another to mine – or does this make me sound like an\\nEpicurean again? No, if a thing is in your interest it is also in my own interest. Otherwise, if any\\nmatter that affects you is no concern of mine, I am not a friend. Friendship creates a community\\nof interest between us in everything. We have neither successes nor setbacks as individuals; our\\nlives have a common end. No one can lead a happy life if he thinks only of himself and turns\\neverything to his own purposes. You should live for the other person if you wish to live for\\nyourself. The assiduous and scrupulous cultivation of this bond, which leads to our associating\\nwith our fellow-men and believes in the existence of a common law for all mankind, contributes\\nmore than anything else to the maintenance of that more intimate bond I was mentioning,\\nfriendship. A person who shares much with a fellow human being will share everything with a\\nfriend.\\nWhat I should like those subtle thinkers – you know the ones I mean, my peerless\\nLucilius – to teach me is this, what my duties are to a friend and to a man, rather than the number\\nof senses in which the expression „friend‟ is used and how many different meanings the word\\n„man‟ has. Before my very eyes wisdom and folly are taking their separate stands: which shall I\\njoin, whose side am I to follow? For one person „man‟ is equivalent to „friend‟, for another „man‟\\nand „friend‟ are far from being identified, and in making a friend one man will be seeking an\\nasset while another will be making himself an asset to the other; and in the midst of all this what\\nyou people do for me is pull words about and cut up syllables. One is led to believe that unless\\none has constructed syllogisms of the craftiest kind, and reduced fallacies to a compact form in\\nwhich a false conclusion is derived from a true premise, one will not be in a position to\\ndistinguish what one should aim at and what one should avoid. It makes one ashamed – that men\\nof our advanced years should turn a thing as serious as this into a game.\\n„Mouse is a syllable, and a mouse nibbles cheese; therefore, a syllable nibbles cheese.‟\\nSuppose for the moment I can‟t detect the fallacy in that. What danger am I placed in by such\\nlack of insight? What serious consequences are there in it for me? What I have to fear, no doubt,\\nis the possibility, one of these days, of my catching a syllable in a mousetrap or even having my\\ncheese eaten up by a book if I‟m not careful. Unless perhaps the following train of logic is a\\nmore acute one: „Mouse is a syllable, and a syllable does not nibble cheese; therefore, a mouse\\ndoes not nibble cheese.‟ What childish fatuities these are! Is this what we philosophers acquire\\nwrinkles in our brows for? Is this what we let our beards grow long for? Is this what we teach\\nwith faces grave and pale?\\nShall I tell you what philosophy holds out to humanity? Counsel. One person is facing\\ndeath, another is vexed by poverty, while another is tormented by wealth – whether his own or\\nsomeone else‟s; one man is appalled by his misfortunes while another longs to get away from his\\nown prosperity; one man is suffering at the hands of men, another at the hands of the gods.\\nWhat‟s the point of concocting whimsies for me of the sort I‟ve just been mentioning? This isn‟t\\nthe place for fun – you‟re called in to help the unhappy. You‟re pledged to bring succour to the\\nshipwrecked, to those in captivity, to the sick, the needy and men who are just placing their\\n\\n\\x0cheads beneath the executioner‟s uplifted axe. Where are you off to? What are you about? The\\nperson you‟re engaging in word-play with is in fear – go to his aid.…* All mankind are\\nstretching out their hands to you on every side. Lives that have been ruined, lives that are on the\\nway to ruin are appealing for some help; it is to you that they look for hope and assistance. They\\nare begging you to extricate them from this awful vortex, to show them in their doubt and\\ndisarray the shining torch of truth. Tell them what nature has made necessary and what she has\\nmade superfluous. Tell them how simple are the laws she has laid down, and how\\nstraightforward and enjoyable life is for those who follow them and how confused and\\ndisagreeable it is for others who put more trust in popular ideas than they do in nature. All right\\nif you can point out to me where those puzzles are likely to bring such people relief. Which of\\nthem removes cravings or brings them under control? If only they were simply unhelpful!\\nThey‟re actually harmful. I‟ll give you the clearest proof whenever you like of their tendency to\\nweaken and enfeeble even eminent talents once applied to such quibbles. And when it comes to\\nsaying how they equip people proposing to do battle with fortune and what weapons they offer\\nthem, one hangs one‟s head with shame. Is this the way to our supreme ideal? Do we get there by\\nmeans of all that „if X, Y, or if not Y, Z‟ one finds in philosophy? And by means of quibbles that\\nwould be shameful and discreditable even among persons occupying themselves with law\\nreports? When you‟re leading the person you‟re questioning into a trap, aren‟t you just making it\\nlook as if he has lost his case on a purely technical point of pleading? The praetor‟s court,\\nhowever, restores litigants losing in this way to their rightful position, and philosophy does the\\nsame for the people thus questioned. Why do philosophers like you abandon the magnificent\\npromises you have made? After assuring me in solemn terms that you will see to it that my eyes\\nshall no more be overwhelmed by the glitter of gold than by the glitter of a sword, that I shall\\nspurn with magnificent strength of purpose the things all other men pray for and the things all\\nother men are afraid of, why do you have to descend to the schoolroom A B C? What do you\\nsay?\\nIs this the way to the heavens?*\\nFor that is what philosophy has promised me – that she will make me God‟s equal. That‟s\\nthe invitation and that‟s what I‟ve come for; be as good as your word.\\nKeep clear, then, my dear Lucilius, as far as you can, of the sort of quibbles and\\nqualifications I‟ve been mentioning in philosophers. Straightforwardness and simplicity are in\\nkeeping with goodness. Even if you had a large part of your life remaining before you, you\\nwould have to organize it very economically to have enough for all the things that are necessary;\\nas things are, isn‟t it the height of folly to learn inessential things when time‟s so desperately\\nshort!\\n\\nLETTER LIII\\nI WONDER whether there‟s anything I couldn‟t be persuaded into now, after letting\\nmyself be persuaded recently into taking a trip by sea. The sea was quite calm when we cast off.\\nThe sky was certainly heavily overcast, with the kind of dark clouds that generally break in a\\nsquall or downpour. But in spite of the uncertain, threatening skies, I thought it would be\\nperfectly feasible to make it across the few miles from your Parthenope over to Puteoli. And so,\\nwith the object of getting the crossing over quicker, I headed straight for Nesis over the open\\nwater to cut out all the intervening curves of the coast-line. Now when I had got so far across that\\nit made no odds whether I went on or turned back, first of all the smoothness which had tempted\\nme to my undoing disappeared. There was no storm as yet, but a heavy swell was running by\\n\\n\\x0cthen and the waves were steadily getting rougher. I began asking the helmsman to put me ashore\\nsomewhere. He kept saying the coast was a rugged one without a haven anywhere and that there\\nwas nothing he feared quite so much in a storm as a lee shore. I was in far too bad a way, though,\\nfor any thought of possible danger to enter my head, as I was suffering the torments of that\\nsluggish brand of seasickness that will not bring one relief, the kind that upsets the stomach\\nwithout clearing it. So I put pressure on him and compelled him, willy-nilly, to make for the\\nshore. Once we were close in there was no waiting on my part for anything to be done in the\\nmanner commended by Virgil,\\nBows faced seawards\\nor\\nAnchor cast from bow.*\\nRemembering my training as a long-standing devotee of cold baths, I dived into the sea in\\njust the way a cold-water addict ought to – in my woolly clothes. You can imagine what I\\nsuffered as I crawled out over the rocks, as I searched for a route to safety or fought my way\\nthere. It made me realize how right sailors are in being afraid of a lee shore. What I endured, in\\nmy inability to endure my then self, is beyond belief. You can take it from me that the reason\\nUlysses got himself wrecked everywhere was not so much because Neptune was against him\\nfrom the day he was born, but because he was given to seasickness like me – it‟ll take me twenty\\nyears to reach my destination, too, if I ever have to journey anywhere by sea!\\nAs soon as I‟d settled my stomach (for stomachs, as you know, aren‟t clear of seasickness\\nthe moment they‟re clear of the sea) and rubbed myself over with embrocation to put some life\\nback into my body, I began to reflect how we are attended by an appalling forgetfulness of our\\nweaknesses, even the physical ones which are continually bringing themselves to our notice, and\\nmuch more so with those that are not only more serious but correspondingly less apparent. A\\nslight feverishness may deceive a person, but when it has developed to the point where a genuine\\nfever is raging it will extract an admission that something is wrong from even a tough and\\nhardened individual. Suppose our feet ache, with little needling pains in the joints: at this stage\\nwe pass it off and say we‟ve sprained an ankle or strained something in some exercise or other;\\nwhile the disorder is in its indeterminate, commencing phase, its name eludes us, but once it\\nstarts bending the feet in just the way an ankle-rack does and makes them both misshapen, we\\nhave to confess that we‟ve got the gout.\\nWith afflictions of the spirit, though, the opposite is the case: the worse a person is, the\\nless he feels it. You needn‟t feel surprised, my dearest Lucilius; a person sleeping lightly\\nperceives impressions in his dreams and is sometimes, even, aware during sleep that he is asleep,\\nwhereas a heavy slumber blots out even dreams and plunges the mind too deep for consciousness\\nof self. Why does no one admit his failings? Because he‟s still deep in them. It‟s the person\\nwho‟s awakened who recounts his dream, and acknowledging one‟s failings is a sign of health.\\nSo let us rouse ourselves, so that we may be able to demonstrate our errors. But only philosophy\\nwill wake us; only philosophy will shake us out of that heavy sleep. Devote yourself entirely to\\nher. You‟re worthy of her, she‟s worthy of you – fall into each other‟s arms. Say a firm, plain no\\nto every other occupation. There‟s no excuse for your pursuing philosophy merely in moments\\nwhen occasion allows. If you were sick you would take a rest from attending to your personal\\naffairs and drop your practice in the courts. And during a spell of improvement in your condition\\nyou wouldn‟t look on any client as being so important that you‟d undertake his case in court. No,\\nyou‟d devote your entire attention to recovering from your illness in the quickest possible time.\\nWell, then, aren‟t you going to do the same in these circumstances? Away with every obstacle\\n\\n\\x0cand leave yourself free to acquire a sound mind – no one ever attains this if he‟s busy with other\\nthings. Philosophy wields an authority of her own; she doesn‟t just accept time, she grants one it.\\nShe‟s not something one takes up in odd moments. She‟s an active, full-time mistress, ever\\npresent and demanding. When some state or other offered Alexander a part of its territory and\\nhalf of all its property he told them that „he hadn‟t come to Asia with the intention of accepting\\nwhatever they cared to give him, but of letting them keep whatever he chose to leave them.‟\\nPhilosophy, likewise, tells all other occupations: „It‟s not my intention to accept whatever time is\\nleft over from you; you shall have, instead, what I reject.‟\\nGive your whole mind to her. Sit at her side and pay her constant court, and an enormous\\ngap will widen between yourself and other men. You‟ll end up far in advance of all mankind,\\nand not far behind the gods themselves. Would you like to know what the actual difference\\nbetween yourself and the gods will be? They will exist for longer. And yet to me what an\\nindisputable mark it is of a great artist to have captured everything in a tiny compass; a wise man\\nhas as much scope before him as a god with all eternity in front of him. There is one thing, too,\\nin which the wise man actually surpasses any god: a god has nature to thank for his immunity\\nfrom fear, while the wise man can thank his own efforts for this. Look at that for an achievement,\\nto have all the frailty of a human being and all the freedom from care of a god. Philosophy‟s\\npower to blunt all the blows of circumstance is beyond belief. Never a missile lodges in her; she\\nhas strong, impenetrable defences; some blows she breaks the force of, parrying them with the\\nslack of her gown as if they were trivial, others she flings off and hurls back at the sender.\\n\\nLETTER LIV\\nILL health – which had granted me quite a long spell of leave – has attacked me without\\nwarning again. „What kind of ill health?‟ you‟ll be asking. And well you may, for there isn‟t a\\nsingle kind I haven‟t experienced. There‟s one particular ailment, though, for which I‟ve always\\nbeen singled out, so to speak. I see no reason why I should call it by its Greek name,* difficulty\\nin breathing being a perfectly good way of describing it. Its onslaught is of very brief duration –\\nlike a squall, it is generally over within the hour. One could hardly, after all, expect anyone to\\nkeep on drawing his last breath for long, could one? I‟ve been visited by all the troublesome or\\ndangerous complaints there are, and none of them, in my opinion, is more unpleasant than this\\none – which is hardly surprising, is it, when you consider that with anything else you‟re merely\\nill, while with this you‟re constantly at your last gasp? This is why doctors have nicknamed it\\n„rehearsing death‟, since sooner or later the breath does just what it has been trying to do all\\nthose times. Do you imagine that as I write this I must be feeling in high spirits at having escaped\\nthis time? No, it would be just as absurd for me to feel overjoyed at its being over – as if this\\nmeant I was a healthy man again – as it would be for a person to think he has won his case on\\nobtaining an extension of time before trial.\\nEven as I fought for breath, though, I never ceased to find comfort in cheerful and\\ncourageous reflections. „What‟s this?‟ I said. „So death is having all these tries at me, is he? Let\\nhim, then! I had a try at him a long while ago myself.‟ „When was this?‟ you‟ll say. Before I was\\nborn. Death is just not being. What that is like I know already. It will be the same after me as it\\nwas before me. If there is any torment in the later state, there must also have been torment in the\\nperiod before we saw the light of day; yet we never felt conscious of any distress then. I ask you,\\nwouldn‟t you say that anyone who took the view that a lamp was worse off when it was put out\\nthan it was before it was lit was an utter idiot? We, too, are lit and put out. We suffer somewhat\\nin the intervening period, but at either end of it there is a deep tranquillity. For, unless I‟m\\n\\n\\x0cmistaken, we are wrong, my dear Lucilius, in holding that death follows after, when in fact it\\nprecedes as well as succeeds. Death is all that was before us. What does it matter, after all,\\nwhether you cease to be or never begin, when the result of either is that you do not exist?\\nI kept on talking to myself in these and similar terms – silently, needless to say, words\\nbeing out of the question. Then little by little the affliction in my breathing, which was coming to\\nbe little more than a panting now, came on at longer intervals and slackened away. It has lasted\\non, all the same, and in spite of the passing of this attack, my breathing is not yet coming\\nnaturally. I feel a sort of catch and hesitation in it. Let it do as it pleases, though, so long as the\\nsighs aren‟t heartfelt. You can feel assured on my score of this: I shall not be afraid when the last\\nhour comes – I‟m already prepared, not planning as much as a day ahead. The man, though,\\nwhom you should admire and imitate is the one who finds it a joy to live and in spite of that is\\nnot reluctant to die. For where‟s the virtue in going out when you‟re really being thrown out?\\nAnd yet there is this virtue about my case: I‟m in the process of being thrown out, certainly, but\\nthe manner of it is as if I were going out. And the reason why it never happens to a wise man is\\nthat being thrown out signifies expulsion from a place one is reluctant to depart from, and there\\nis nothing the wise man does reluctantly. He escapes necessity because he wills what necessity is\\ngoing to force on him.\\n\\nLETTER LV\\nI‟VE just this moment returned from a ride in my sedanchair, feeling as tired as if I‟d\\nwalked the whole distance instead of being seated all the way. Even to be carried for any length\\nof time is hard work, and all the more so, I dare say, because it is unnatural, nature having given\\nus legs with which to do our own walking, just as she gave us eyes with which to do our own\\nseeing. Soft living imposes on us the penalty of debility; we cease to be able to do the things\\nwe‟ve long been grudging about doing. However, I was needing to give my body a shaking up,\\neither to dislodge some phlegm, perhaps, that had collected in my throat, or to have some\\nthickness, due to one cause or another, in my actual breathing reduced by the motion, which I‟ve\\nnoticed before has done me some good. So I deliberately continued the ride for quite a long way,\\nwith the beach itself tempting me onwards. It sweeps round between Cumae and Servilius\\nVatia‟s country house in a sort of narrow causeway with the sea on one side and a lagoon on the\\nother. A recent storm had left it firm; for, as you know, a fast-running heavy surf makes a beach\\nflat and smooth, while a longish period of calm weather leads to a disintegration of this surface\\nwith the disappearance of the moisture that binds the particles of sand together.\\nI had started looking around me in my usual way to see whether I could find anything I\\ncould turn to good account, when my eyes turned to the house which had once belonged to Vatia.\\nThis was the place where Vatia passed the latter part of his life, a wealthy man who had held the\\noffice of praetor but was famed for nothing but his life of retirement, and considered a fortunate\\nman on that ground alone. For whenever a man was ruined through being a friend of Asinius\\nGallus or an enemy of Sejanus, or devoted to Sejanus (for it came to be as dangerous to have\\nbeen a follower of his as it was to cross him), people used to exclaim, „Vatia, you‟re the only\\nperson who knows how to live!‟ What in fact he knew was how to hide rather than how to live.\\nAnd there is a lot of difference between your life being a retiring one and its being a spineless\\none. I never used to pass this house while Vatia was alive without saying, „Here lieth Vatia.‟ But\\nphilosophy, my dear Lucilius, is such a holy thing and inspires so much respect, that even\\nsomething that resembles it has a specious appeal. Let a man retire and the common crowd will\\nthink of him as leading a life apart, free of all cares, self-contented, living for himself, when in\\n\\n\\x0cfact not one of these blessings can be won by anyone other than the philosopher. He alone knows\\nhow to live for himself: he is the one, in fact, who knows the fundamental thing, how to live. The\\nperson who has run away from the world and his fellow-men, whose exile is due to the\\nunsuccessful outcome of his own desires, who is unable to endure the sight of others more\\nfortunate, who has taken to some place of hiding in his alarm like a timid, inert animal, he is not\\n„living for himself‟, but for his belly and his sleep and his passions – in utter degradation, in\\nother words. The fact that a person is living for nobody does not automatically mean that he is\\nliving for himself. Still, a persevering steadfastness of purpose counts for a lot, so that even\\ninertia if stubbornly maintained may carry a certain weight.\\nI can‟t give you any accurate information about the house itself. I only know the front of\\nit and the parts in view, the parts that it displays even to passers-by. There are two artificial\\ngrottoes, considerable feats of engineering, each as big as the most spacious hall, one of them not\\nletting in the sun at all, the other retaining it right up until its setting. There is a grove of plane\\ntrees through the middle of which runs a stream flowing alternately, like a tide-race, into the sea\\nand into the Acherusian Lake, a stream capable of supporting a stock of fish even if constantly\\nexploited; it is left alone, though, when the sea is open: only when bad weather gives the\\nfishermen a holiday do they lay hands on this ready supply. But the most advantageous feature of\\nthe house is that it has Baiae next door; it enjoys all the amenities of that resort and is free from\\nits disadvantages. I can speak for these attractions from personal knowledge, and I am quite\\nprepared to believe, too, that it is an all-the-year-round house, since it lies in the path of the\\nwestern breeze, catching it to such an extent as to exclude Baiae from the benefit of it. Vatia\\nseems to have been no fool in choosing this place as the one in which he would spend his\\nretirement, sluggish and senile as that retirement had become.\\nThe place one‟s in, though, doesn‟t make any contribution to peace of mind: it‟s the spirit\\nthat makes everything agreeable to oneself. I‟ve seen for myself people sunk in gloom in\\ncheerful and delightful country houses, and people in completely secluded surroundings who\\nlooked as if they were run off their feet. So there‟s no reason why you should feel that you‟re not\\nas much at rest in your mind as you might be just because you‟re not here in Campania. Why\\naren‟t you, for that matter? Transmit your thoughts all the way here. There‟s nothing to stop you\\nenjoying the company of absent friends, as often as you like, too, and for as long as you like.\\nThis pleasure in their company – and there‟s no greater pleasure – is one we enjoy the more\\nwhen we‟re absent from one another. For having our friends present makes us spoilt; as a result\\nof our talking and walking and sitting together every now and then, on being separated we\\nhaven‟t a thought for those we‟ve just been seeing. One good reason, too, why we should endure\\nthe absence patiently is the fact that every one of us is absent to a great extent from his friends\\neven when they are around. Count up in this connexion first the nights spent away from one\\nanother, then the different engagements that keep each one busy, then the time passed in the\\nprivacy of one‟s study and in trips into the country, and you‟ll see that periods abroad don‟t\\ndeprive us of so very much. Possession of a friend should be with the spirit: the spirit‟s never\\nabsent: it sees daily whoever it likes. So share with me my studies, my meals, my walks. Life\\nwould be restricted indeed if there were any barrier to our imaginations. I see you, my dear\\nLucilius, I hear you at this very moment. I feel so very much with you that I wonder whether I\\nshouldn‟t start writing you notes rather than letters!\\n\\nLETTER LVI\\nI CANNOT for the life of me see that quiet is as necessary to a person who has shut\\n\\n\\x0chimself away to do some studying as it is usually thought to be. Here am I with a babel of noise\\ngoing on all about me. I have lodgings right over a public bathhouse. Now imagine to yourself\\nevery kind of sound that can make one weary of one‟s years. When the strenuous types are doing\\ntheir exercises, swinging weight-laden hands about, I hear the grunting as they toil away – or go\\nthrough the motions of toiling away – at them, and the hissings and strident gasps every time\\nthey expel their pent up breath. When my attention turns to a less active fellow who is contenting\\nhimself with an ordinary inexpensive massage, I hear the smack of a hand pummelling his\\nshoulders, the sound varying according as it comes down flat or cupped. But if on top of this\\nsome ball player comes along and starts shouting out the score, that‟s the end! Then add\\nsomeone starting up a brawl, and someone else caught thieving, and the man who likes the sound\\nof his voice in the bath, and the people who leap into the pool with a tremendous splash. Apart\\nfrom those whose voices are, if nothing else, natural, think of the hair remover, continually\\ngiving vent to his shrill and penetrating cry in order to advertise his presence, never silent unless\\nit be while he is plucking someone‟s armpits and making the client yell for him! Then think of\\nthe various cries of the man selling drinks, and the one selling sausages and the other selling\\npastries, and all the ones hawking for the catering shops, each publicizing his wares with a\\ndistinctive cry of his own.\\n„You must be made of iron,‟ you may say, „or else hard of hearing if your mind is\\nunaffected by all this babel of discordant noises around you, when continual “good morning”\\ngreetings were enough to finish off the Stoic Chrysippus!‟ But I swear I no more notice all this\\nroar of noise than I do the sound of waves or falling water – even if I am here told the story of a\\npeople on the Nile who moved their capital solely because they could not stand the thundering of\\na cataract! Voices, I think, are more inclined to distract one than general noise; noise merely fills\\none‟s ears, battering away at them while voices actually catch one‟s attention. Among the things\\nwhich create a racket all around me without distracting me at all I include the carriages hurrying\\nby in the street, the carpenter who works in the same block, a man in the neighbourhood who\\nsaws, and this fellow tuning horns and flutes at the Trickling Fountain and emitting blasts instead\\nof music. I still find an intermittent noise more irritating than a continuous one. But by now I\\nhave so steeled myself against all these things that I can even put up with a coxswain‟s strident\\ntones as he gives his oarsmen the rhythm. For I force my mind to become self-absorbed and not\\nlet outside things distract it. There can be absolute bedlam without so long as there is no\\ncommotion within, so long as fear and desire are not at loggerheads, so long as meanness and\\nextravagance are not at odds and harassing each other. For what is the good of having silence\\nthroughout the neighbourhood if one‟s emotions are in turmoil?\\nThe peaceful stillness of the night had lulled\\nThe world to rest.*\\nThis is incorrect. There is no such thing as „peaceful stillness‟ except where reason has\\nlulled it to rest. Night does not remove our worries; it brings them to the surface. All it gives us is\\na change of anxieties. For even when people are asleep they have dreams as troubled as their\\ndays. The only true serenity is the one which represents the free development of a sound mind.\\nLook at the man whose quest for sleep demands absolute quiet from his spacious house. To\\nprevent any sound disturbing his ears every one of his host of slaves preserves total silence and\\nthose who come anywhere near him walk on tip-toe. Naturally enough he tosses from side to\\nside, trying to snatch some fitful sleep in between the spells of fretting, and complains of having\\nheard sounds when he never heard them at all. And what do you suppose is the reason? His mind\\nis in a ferment. It is this which needs to be set at peace. Here is the mutiny that needs to be\\n\\n\\x0csuppressed. The fact that the body is lying down is no reason for supposing that the mind is at\\npeace. Rest is sometimes far from restful. Hence our need to be stimulated into general activity\\nand kept occupied and busy with pursuits of the right nature whenever we are victims of the sort\\nof idleness that wearies of itself. When great military commanders notice indiscipline among\\ntheir men they suppress it by giving them some work to do, mounting expeditions to keep them\\nactively employed. People who are really busy never have enough time to become skittish. And\\nthere is nothing so certain as the fact that the harmful consequences of inactivity are dissipated\\nby activity.\\nWe commonly give the impression that the reasons for our having gone into political\\nretirement are our disgust with public life and our dissatisfaction with some uncongenial and\\nunrewarding post. Yet every now and then ambition rears its head again in the retreat into which\\nwe were really driven by our apprehensions and our waning interest; for our ambition did not\\ncease because it had been rooted out, but merely because it had tired – or become piqued,\\nperhaps, at its lack of success. I would say the same about extravagant living, which appears on\\noccasion to have left one and then, when one has declared for the simple life, places temptation\\nin the way. In the middle of one‟s programme of frugality it sets out after pleasures which one\\nhad discarded but not condemned, its pursuit of them indeed being all the more ardent the less\\none is aware of it. For when they are in the open vices invariably take a more moderate form;\\ndiseases too are on the way towards being cured when once they have broken out, instead of\\nbeing latent, and made their presence felt. So it is with the love of money, the love of power and\\nthe other maladies that affect the minds of men – you may be sure that it is when they abate and\\ngive every appearance of being cured that they are at their most dangerous. We give the\\nimpression of being in retirement, and are nothing of the kind. For if we are genuine in this, if we\\nhave sounded the retreat and really turned away from the surface show, then, as I was saying a\\nlittle while ago, nothing will distract us. Men and birds together in full chorus will never break\\ninto our thinking when that thinking is good and has at last come to be of a sure and steady\\ncharacter.\\nThe temperament that starts at the sound of a voice or chance noises in general is an\\nunstable one and one that has yet to attain inward detachment. It has an element of uneasiness in\\nit, and an element of the rooted fear that makes a man a prey to anxiety, as in the description\\ngiven by our Virgil:\\nAnd I, who formerly would never flinch\\nAt flying spears or serried ranks of Greeks,\\nAm now alarmed by every breeze and roused\\nBy every sound to nervousness, in fear\\nFor this companion and this load alike.*\\nThe earlier character here is the wise man, who knows no fear at the hurtling of missiles,\\nor the clash of weapons against weapons in the close-packed ranks, or the thunderous noise of a\\ncity in destruction. The other, later one has everything to learn; fearing for his belongings he\\npales at every noise; a single cry, whatever it is, prostrates him, being immediately taken for the\\nyelling of the enemy; the slightest movement frightens him out of his life; his baggage makes\\nhim a coward. Pick out any one of your „successful‟ men, with all they trail or carry about with\\nthem, and you will have a picture of the man „in fear for this companion and this load‟. You may\\nbe sure, then, that you are at last „lulled to rest‟ when noise never reaches you and when voices\\nnever shake you out of yourself, whether they be menacing or inviting or just a meaningless\\nhubbub of empty sound all round you.\\n\\n\\x0c„This is all very well,‟ you may say, „but isn‟t it sometimes a lot simpler just to keep\\naway from the din?‟ I concede that, and in fact it is the reason why I shall shortly be moving\\nelsewhere. What I wanted was to give myself a test and some practice. Why should I need to\\nsuffer the torture any longer than I want to when Ulysses found so easy a remedy for his\\ncompanions even against the Sirens?*\\n\\nLETTER LXIII\\nI AM very sorry to hear of your friend Flaccus‟ death. Still, I would not have you grieve\\nunduly over it. I can scarcely venture to demand that you should not grieve at all – and yet I am\\nconvinced that it is better that way. But who will ever be granted that strength of character,\\nunless he be a man already lifted far out of fortune‟s reach? Even he will feel a twinge of pain\\nwhen a thing like this happens – but only a twinge. As for us, we can be pardoned for having\\ngiven way to tears so long as they have not run down in excessive quantities and we have\\nchecked them for ourselves. When one has lost a friend one‟s eyes should be neither dry nor\\nstreaming. Tears, yes, there should be, but not lamentation. Can you find the rule I am laying\\ndown a harsh one when the greatest of Greek poets has restricted to a single day, no more, a\\nperson‟s right to cry – in the passage where he tells us that even Niobe remembered to eat?*\\nWould you like to know what lies behind extravagant weeping and wailing? In our tears we are\\ntrying to find means of proving that we feel the loss. We are not being governed by our grief but\\nparading it. No one ever goes into mourning for the benefit merely of himself. Oh, the miserable\\nfolly of it all – that there should be an element of ostentation in grief!\\n„Come now,‟ you will be asking, „are you saying that I should forget a person who has\\nbeen a friend?‟ Well, you are not proposing to keep him very long in your memory if his\\nmemory is to last just as long as your grief. At any moment something or other will happen that\\nwill turn that long face of yours into a smiling one. I do not see very much time going by before\\nthe sense of loss is mitigated and even the keenest sorrowings settle down. Your face will cease\\nto be its present picture of sadness as soon as you take your eyes off yourself. At the moment you\\nare keeping a watch on your grief – but even as you do it is fading away, and the keener it is the\\nquicker it is in stopping.\\nLet us see to it that the recollection of those we have lost becomes a pleasure to us.\\nNobody really cares to cast his mind back to something which he is never going to think of\\nwithout pain. Inevitable as it is that the names of persons who were dear to us and are now lost\\nshould cause us a gnawing sort of pain when we think of them, that pain is not without a pleasure\\nof its own. As my teacher Attalus used to say, „In the pleasure we find in the memory of departed\\nfriends there is a resemblance to the way in which certain bitter fruits are agreeable or the very\\nacidity of an exceedingly old wine has its attraction. But after a certain interval all that pained us\\nis obliterated and the enjoyment comes to us unalloyed.‟ If we are to believe him, „Thinking of\\nfriends who are alive and well is like feasting on cakes and honey. Recalling those who are gone\\nis pleasant but not without a touch of sourness. Who would deny, though, that even acid things\\nlike this with a harshness in their taste do stimulate the palate?‟ Personally I do not agree with\\nhim there. Thinking of departed friends is to me something sweet and mellow. For when I had\\nthem with me it was with the feeling that I was going to lose them, and now that I have lost them\\nI keep the feeling that I have them with me still.\\nSo, my dear Lucilius, behave in keeping with your usual fair-mindedness and stop\\nmisinterpreting the kindness of fortune. She has given as well as taken away. Let us therefore go\\nall out to make the most of friends, since no one can tell how long we shall have the opportunity.\\n\\n\\x0cLet us just think how often we leave them behind when we are setting out on some long journey\\nor other, or how often we fail to see them when we are staying in the same area, and we shall\\nrealize that we have lost all too much time while they are still alive. Can you stand people who\\ntreat their friends with complete neglect and then mourn them to distraction, never caring about\\nanyone unless they have lost him? And the reason they lament them so extravagantly then is that\\nthey are afraid people may wonder whether they did care; they are looking for belated means of\\ndemonstrating their devotion. If we have other friends, we are hardly kind or appreciative of\\nthem if they count for so very little when it comes to consoling us for the one we have buried. If\\nwe have no other friends, we have done ourselves a greater injury than fortune has done us: she\\nhas deprived us of a single friend but we have deprived ourselves of every friend we have failed\\nto make. A person, moreover, who has not been able to care about more than one friend cannot\\nhave cared even about that one too much. Supposing someone lost his one and only shirt in a\\nrobbery, would you not think him an utter idiot if he chose to bewail his loss rather than look\\nabout him for some means of keeping out the cold and find something to put over his shoulders?\\nYou have buried someone you loved. Now look for someone to love. It is better to make good\\nthe loss of a friend than to cry over him.\\nWhat I am about to go on to say is, I know, a commonplace, but I am not going to omit it\\nmerely because every one has said it. Even a person who has not deliberately put an end to his\\ngrief finds an end to it in the passing of time. And merely growing weary of sorrowing is quite\\nshameful as a means of curing sorrow in the case of an enlightened man. I should prefer to see\\nyou abandoning grief than it abandoning you. Much as you may wish to, you will not be able to\\nkeep it up for very long, so give it up as early as possible. For women our forefathers fixed the\\nperiod of mourning at a year with the intention, not that women should continue mourning as\\nlong as that, but that they should not go on any longer: for men no period is prescribed at all\\nbecause none would be decent. Yet out of all the pathetic females you know of who were only\\ndragged away from the graveside, or even torn from the body itself, with the greatest of\\ndifficulty, can you show me one whose tears lasted for a whole month? Nothing makes itself\\nunpopular quite so quickly as a person‟s grief. When it is fresh it attracts people to its side, finds\\nsomeone to offer it consolation; but if it is perpetuated it becomes an object of ridicule –\\ndeservedly, too, for it is either feigned or foolish.\\nAnd all this comes to you from me, the very man who wept for Annaeus Serenus, that\\ndearest of friends to me, so unrestrainedly that I must needs be included – though this is the last\\nthing I should want – among examples of men who have been defeated by grief! Nevertheless I\\ncondemn today the way I behaved then. I realize now that my sorrowing in the way I did was\\nmainly due to the fact that I had never considered the possibility of his dying before me. That he\\nwas younger than I was, a good deal younger top, was all that ever occurred to me – as if fate\\npaid any regard to seniority! So let us bear it constantly in mind that those we are fond of are just\\nas liable to death as we are ourselves. What I should have said before was, „My friend Serenus is\\nyounger than I am, but what difference does that make? He should die later than me, but it is\\nquite possible he will die before me.‟ It was just because I did not do so that fortune caught me\\nunprepared with that sudden blow. Now I bear it in mind not only that all things are liable to\\ndeath but that that liability is governed by no set rules. Whatever can happen at any time can\\nhappen today. Let us reflect then, my dearest Lucilius, that we ourselves shall not be long in\\nreaching the place we mourn his having reached. Perhaps, too, if only there is truth in the story\\ntold by sages and some welcoming abode awaits us, he whom we suppose to be dead and gone\\nhas merely been sent on ahead.\\n\\n\\x0cLETTER LXV\\nI SHARED yesterday with a bout of illness. It claimed the morning but it let me have the\\nafternoon. So I started off by doing some reading to see what energy I had. Then, as it proved up\\nto this, I ventured to make further demands on it – or perhaps I should say concessions to it – and\\ndid some writing. I was at this with more than my customary concentration, too, what with the\\ndifficulty of the subject and my refusal to give in, until some friends of mine put a stop to it,\\napplying force to restrain me as if I were an invalid who was recklessly overdoing things. The\\npen gave place to talk, which included the following matter of dispute that I shall now state to\\nyou. We have appointed you as arbitrator – and you have more of a case on your hands than you\\nthink, for the contest is a three-cornered one.\\nOur Stoic philosophers, as you know, maintain that there are two elements in the universe\\nfrom which all things are derived, namely cause and matter. Matter lies inert and inactive, a\\nsubstance with unlimited potential, but destined to remain idle if no one sets it in motion; and it\\nis cause (this meaning the same as reason) which turns matter to whatever end it wishes and\\nfashions it into a variety of different products. There must, then, be something out of which\\nthings come into being and something else by means of which things come into being; the first is\\nmatter and the second is cause. Now all art is an imitation of nature. So apply what I was saying\\nabout the universe to man‟s handiwork. Take a statue: it had the matter to be worked on by the\\nsculptor and it had the sculptor to give configuration to the matter – bronze, in other words, in\\nthe case of the statue, being the matter and the craftsman the cause. It is the same with all things:\\nthey consist of something which comes into being and something else which brings them into\\nbeing.\\nStoics believe that there is only one cause – that which brings things into being. Aristotle\\nthinks that the term „cause‟ can be used in three different ways. „The first cause,‟ he says, „is\\nmatter – without it nothing can be brought into existence. The second is the craftsman, and the\\nthird is form, which is impressed on every single piece of work as on a statue.‟ This last is what\\nAristotle calls the idos. „And,‟ he says, „there is a fourth as well, the purpose of the whole work.‟\\nLet me explain what this means. The „first cause‟ of the statue is the bronze, as it would never\\nhave been made unless there had been something out of which it could be cast or moulded. The\\n„second cause‟ is the sculptor, as the bronze could not have been shaped into the state in which it\\nis without those skilled hands having come to it. The „third cause‟ is the form, as our statue could\\nnot have been called „The Man with the Spear‟ or „The Boy tying up his Hair‟* had this not been\\nthe guise impressed on it. The „fourth cause‟ is the end in view in its making, for had this not\\nexisted the statue would never have been made at all. What is this end? It is what attracted the\\nsculptor, what his goal was in creating it: it may have been money, if when he worked it he was\\ngoing to sell it, or fame, if the aim of his endeavours was to win a name, or religion, if it was a\\nwork for presentation to a temple. This too, then, is a cause of the statue‟s coming into being –\\nunless you take the view that things in the absence of which the statue would never have been\\ncreated should not be included among the causes of the particular creation.\\nTo these four causes Plato adds a fifth in the model – what he himself calls the idea – this\\nbeing what the sculptor had constantly before his eyes as he executed the intended work.\\nIt does not matter whether he has his model without, one to which he can direct his eyes,\\nor within, conceived and set up by the artist inside his own head. God has within himself models\\nlike this of everything in the universe, his mind embracing the designs and calculations for his\\nprojects; he is full of these images which Plato calls ideas, eternal, immutable, ever dynamic. So\\n\\n\\x0cthough human beings may perish, humanity in itself – the pattern on which every human being is\\nmoulded – lasts on, and while human beings go through much and pass away itself remains quite\\nunaffected. As Plato has it, then, there are five causes: the material, the agent, the form, the\\nmodel and the end; and finally we get the result of all these. In the case of the statue, to use the\\nexample we began with, the material is the bronze, the agent is the sculptor, the form is the guise\\nit is given, the model is what the sculptor making it copies, the end is what the maker has in\\nview, and the final result is the statue itself. The universe as well, according to Plato, has all\\nthese elements. The maker is God; matter is the material; the form is the general character and\\nlay-out of the universe as we see it; the model naturally enough is the pattern which God adopted\\nfor the creation of this stupendous work in all its beauty; the end is what God had in view when\\nhe created it, and that – in case you are asking what is the end God has in view – is goodness.\\nThat at any rate is what Plato says: „What was the cause of God‟s creating the universe? He is\\ngood, and whoever is good can never be grudging with anything good; so he made it as good a\\nworld as it was in his power to make it.‟\\nNow it is for you as judge to pronounce your verdict and declare whose statement in your\\nopinion seems to be – not the truest (for that here is as far out of our reach as Truth herself) – but\\nmost like the truth.\\nThis assortment of causes which Aristotle and Plato have collected together embraces\\neither too much or too little. For if they take the view that everything in the absence of which a\\nthing cannot be brought into being is a cause of its creation, they have failed to name enough.\\nThey should be including time in their list of causes – nothing can come into being without time.\\nThey should be including place – a thing will certainly not come into being if there is nowhere\\nfor this to happen. They should be including motion – without this nothing either comes into\\nexistence or goes out of existence; without motion there is no such thing as art and no such thing\\nas change. What we are looking for at the moment is a primary and general cause. And this must\\nbe something elementary, since matter too is elementary. If we ask what cause is, surely the\\nanswer is creative reason, that is to say God. All those things which you have listed are not an\\narray of individual causes, but dependent on a single one, the cause that actually creates. You\\nmay say form is a cause, but form is something which the artist imposes on his work – a part of\\nthe cause, yes, but not a cause. The model, too, is an indispensable instrument of the cause, but\\nnot a cause. To the sculptor his model is as indispensable as his chisel or his file: his art can get\\nnowhere without them, but this does not make them parts or causes of the art. „The end the artist\\nhas in view,‟ our friend says, „the thing which induces him to set about a work of creation, is a\\ncause.‟ Even if we grant that it is, it is only an accessory cause, not the effective cause.\\nAccessory causes are infinite in number; what we are after is the general cause. In any event that\\nassertion on the part of Plato and Aristotle that the universe in its entirety, the whole, completed\\nwork of creation, is a cause is not in keeping with their usual acuteness as thinkers. There is a\\nvery great difference between a creation and its cause.\\nNow you must either pronounce your verdict or – the easier course in matters of this\\nnature – declare your inability to arrive at one and order a rehearing. „What pleasure,‟ you may\\nsay, „do you get out of frittering time away discussing those questions? It‟s not as if you could\\nsay they rid you of any emotion or drive out any desire.‟ Well, in raising and arguing these less\\ndeserving topics my own attitude is that they serve to calm the spirit, and that whilst I examine\\nmyself first, certainly, I examine the universe around me afterwards. I am not even wasting time,\\nas you suppose, at the moment. For those questions, provided they are not subjected to a mincing\\nor dissection with the useless kind of over-subtlety we have just seen as the result, all elevate and\\n\\n\\x0clighten the spirit, the soul which yearns to win free of the heavy load it is saddled with here and\\nreturn to the world where it once belonged. For to it this body of ours is a burden and a torment.\\nAnd harassed by the body‟s overwhelming weight, the soul is in captivity unless philosophy\\ncomes to its rescue, bidding it breathe more freely in the contemplation of nature, releasing it\\nfrom earthly into heavenly surroundings. This to the soul means freedom, the ability to wander\\nfar and free; it steals away for a while from the prison in which it is confined and has its strength\\nrenewed in the world above. When craftsmen engaged on some intricate piece of work which\\nimposes a tiring strain on the eyes have to work by an inadequate and undependable light, they\\ngo out into the open air and treat their eyes to the free sunshine in some open space or other\\ndedicated to public recreation. In the same way the soul, shut away in this dim and dismal\\ndwelling, as often as it can makes for the open and finds its relaxation in contemplating the\\nnatural universe. The wise man and devotee of philosophy is needless to say inseparable from his\\nbody, and yet he is detached from it so far as the best part of his personality is concerned,\\ndirecting his thoughts towards things far above. He looks on this present life of his, much like the\\nman who has signed on as a soldier, as the term he has to serve out. And he is so made that he\\nneither loves life nor hates it. He endures the lot of mortality even though he knows there is a\\nfiner one in store for him.\\nAre you telling me not to investigate the natural world? Are you trying to bar me from\\nthe whole of it and restrict me to a part of it? Am I not to inquire how everything in the universe\\nbegan, who gave things form, who separated them out when they were all plunged together in a\\nsingle great conglomeration of inert matter? Am I not to inquire into the identity of the artist who\\ncreated that universe? Or the process by which this huge mass became subject to law and order?\\nOr the nature of the one who collected the things that were scattered apart, sorted apart the things\\nthat were commingled, and when all things lay in formless chaos allotted them their individual\\nshapes? Or the source of the light (is it fire or is it something brighter?) that is shed on us in such\\nabundance? Am I supposed not to inquire into this sort of thing? Am I not to know where I am\\ndescended from, whether I am to see this world only once or be born into it again time after time,\\nwhat my destination is to be after my stay here, what abode will await my soul on its release\\nfrom the terms of its serfdom on earth? Are you forbidding me to associate with heaven, in other\\nwords ordering me to go through life with my eyes bent on the ground? I am too great, was born\\nto too great a destiny to be my body‟s slave. So far as I am concerned that body is nothing more\\nor less than a fetter on my freedom. I place it squarely in the path of fortune, letting her expend\\nher onslaught on it, not allowing any blow to get through it to my actual self. For that body is all\\nthat is vulnerable about me: within this dwelling so liable to injury there lives a spirit that is free.\\nNever shall that flesh compel me to feel fear, never shall it drive me to any pretence unworthy of\\na good man; never shall I tell a lie out of consideration for this petty body. I shall dissolve our\\npartnership when this seems the proper course, and even now while we are bound one to the\\nother the partnership will not be on equal terms: the soul will assume undivided authority.\\nRefusal to be influenced by one‟s body assures one‟s freedom.\\nAnd to this freedom (to get back to the subject) even the kind of inquiries we were\\ntalking about just now have a considerable contribution to make. We know that everything in the\\nuniverse is composed of matter and of God. God, encompassed within them, controls them all,\\nthey following his leadership and guidance. Greater power and greater value reside in that which\\ncreates (in this case God) than in the matter on which God works. Well, the place which in this\\nuniverse is occupied by God is in man the place of the spirit. What matter is in the universe the\\nbody is in us. Let the worse, then, serve the better. Let us meet with bravery whatever may befall\\n\\n\\x0cus. Let us never feel a shudder at the thought of being wounded or of being made a prisoner, or\\nof poverty or persecution. What is death? Either a transition or an end. I am not afraid of coming\\nto an end, this being the same as never having begun, nor of transition, for I shall never be in\\nconfinement quite so cramped anywhere else as I am here.\\n\\nLETTER LXXVII\\nTODAY we saw some boats from Alexandria – the ones they call „the mail packets‟ –\\ncome into view all of a sudden. They were the ones which are normally sent ahead to announce\\nthe coming of the fleet that will arrive behind them. The sight of them is always a welcome one\\nto the Campanians. The whole of Puteoli crowded onto the wharves, all picking out the\\nAlexandrian vessels from an immense crowd of other shipping by the actual trim of their sails,\\nthese boats being the only vessels allowed to keep their topsails spread. Out at sea all ships carry\\nthese sails, for nothing makes quite the same contribution to speed as the upper canvas, the area\\nfrom which a boat derives the greatest part of its propulsion. That is why whenever the wind\\nstiffens and becomes unduly strong sail is shortened, the wind having less force lower down. On\\nentering the channel between Capri and the headland from which\\nUpon the storm-swept summit Pallas keeps\\nHer high lookout,*\\nregulations require all other vessels to confine themselves to carrying a mainsail, and the\\ntopsail is accordingly conspicuous on the Alexandrian boats.\\nWhile everyone around me was hurrying thus from all directions to the waterfront, I\\nfound a great deal of pleasure in refusing to bestir myself. Although there would be letters for me\\nfrom my people over there I was in no hurry to know what reports they might be carrying or\\nwhat might be the state of my financial interests there. For a long time now I have not been\\nconcerned about any profit or loss. This particular pleasure was one that I ought to have been\\nexperiencing even if I were not an old man; but being old in fact made it all the greater, for it\\nmeant that however little money I might have I should still have more left to cover the journey\\nthan distance left to be covered – especially as the journey on which we have all set out is one\\nwhich does not have to be travelled to the very end. An ordinary journey will be incomplete if\\nyou come to a stop in the middle of it, or anywhere short of your destination, but life is never\\nincomplete if it is an honourable one. At whatever point you leave life, if you leave it in the right\\nway, it is a whole. And there are many occasions on which a man should leave life not only\\nbravely but for reasons which are not as pressing as they might be – the reasons which restrain us\\nbeing not so pressing either.\\nTullius Marcellinus, whom you knew very well, a man, old before his years, who found\\ntranquillity early in life, began to meditate suicide after he had gone down with a disease which\\nwas not an incurable one but at the same time was a protracted, troublesome one, importunate in\\nits demands. He called together a large number of his friends, and each one offered him advice.\\nThis consisted either of urgings (from the timid among them) that he should just take whichever\\ncourse he himself felt urged to take, or of whatever counsel flattering admirers thought would be\\nmost likely to gratify someone meditating suicide, until a Stoic friend of mine, an outstanding\\npersonality for whom I can find no more fitting compliment than that of calling him a man of\\nfighting courage, gave what I thought was the most inspiring advice. This was how he began:\\n„My dear Marcellinus,‟ he said, „you mustn‟t let this worry you as if you were having to make a\\ngreat decision. There‟s nothing so very great about living – all your slaves and all the animals do\\nit. What is, however, a great thing is to die in a manner which is honourable, enlightened and\\n\\n\\x0ccourageous. Think how long now you‟ve been doing the same as them – food, sleep, sex, the\\nnever-ending cycle. The desire for death can be experienced not merely by the enlightened or the\\nbrave or the unhappy, but even by the squeamish.‟ Well, Marcellinus wanted no urging, only a\\nhelper. His slaves refused to obey him in this, whereupon our Stoic talked away their fears,\\nletting them know that the household staff could only be in danger if there had been any room for\\ndoubt as to whether their master‟s death had been a voluntary one; besides, he told them, it was\\njust as bad to let other people see you ordering your master not to kill himself as actually to kill\\nhim. He then suggested to Marcellinus himself that it would not be an unkind gesture if, in the\\nsame way as at the end of a dinner the leftovers are divided among the attendants, something\\nwere offered at the end of his life to those who had served throughout it. Marcellinus had a\\ngenerous and good-natured disposition which was no less evident where it meant personal\\nexpense, and he distributed accordingly little sums of money among his slaves, who were now in\\ntears, and went out of his way to comfort them all. He did not need to resort to a weapon or to\\nshedding blood. After going without food for three days he had a steam tent put up, in his own\\nbedroom; a bath was brought in, in which he lay for a long time, and as fresh supplies of hot\\nwater were continually poured in he passed almost imperceptibly away, not without, as he\\ncommented more than once, a kind of pleasurable sensation, one that is apt to be produced by the\\ngentle fading out of which those of us who have ever fainted will have some experience.\\nI have digressed, but you will not have minded hearing this story, since you will gather\\nfrom it that your friend‟s departure was not a difficult or unhappy one. Although his death was\\nself-inflicted, the manner of his passing was supremely relaxed, a mere gliding out of life. Yet\\nthe story is not without its practical value for the future. For frequently enough necessity\\ndemands just such examples. The times are frequent enough when we cannot reconcile ourselves\\nto dying, or to knowing that we ought to die.\\nNo one is so ignorant as not to know that some day he must die. Nevertheless when death\\ndraws near he turns, wailing and trembling, looking for a way out. Wouldn‟t you think a man a\\nprize fool if he burst into tears because he didn‟t live a thousand years ago? A man is as much a\\nfool for shedding tears because he isn‟t going to be alive a thousand years from now. There‟s no\\ndifference between the one and the other – you didn‟t exist and you won‟t exist – you‟ve no\\nconcern with either period. This is the moment you‟ve been pitched into – supposing you were to\\nmake it longer how long would you make it? What‟s the point of tears? What‟s the point of\\nprayers? You‟re only wasting your breath.\\nSo give up hoping that your prayers can bring\\nSome change in the decisions of the gods.*\\nThose decisions are fixed and permanent, part of the mighty and eternal train of destiny.\\nYou will go the way that all things go. What is strange about that? This is the law to which you\\nwere born; it was the lot of your father, your mother, your ancestors and of all who came before\\nyou as it will be of all who come after you. There is no means of altering the irresistible\\nsuccession of events which carries all things along in its binding grip. Think of the multitudes of\\npeople doomed to die that will be following you, that will be keeping you company! I imagine\\nyou‟d be braver about it if thousands upon thousands were dying with you: the fact is that men as\\nwell as other creatures are breathing their last in one way or another in just such numbers at the\\nvery instant when you‟re unable to make your mind up about death. You weren‟t thinking,\\nsurely, that you wouldn‟t yourself one day arrive at the destination towards which you‟ve been\\nheading from the beginning? Every journey has its end.\\nHere I imagine you‟ll be expecting me to tell you the stories of examples set by heroic\\n\\n\\x0cmen? Well, I‟ll tell you about ones which children have set. History relates the story of the\\nfamous Spartan, a mere boy who, when he was taken prisoner, kept shouting in his native Doric,\\n„I shall not be a slave!‟ He was as good as his word. The first time he was ordered to perform a\\nslave‟s task, some humiliating household job (his actual orders were to fetch a disgusting\\nchamber pot), he dashed his head against a wall and cracked his skull open. Freedom is as near\\nas that – is anyone really still a slave?54 Would you not rather your own son died like that than\\nlived by reason of spinelessness to an advanced age? Why be perturbed, then, about death when\\neven a child can meet it bravely? Suppose you refuse to follow him: you will just be dragged\\nafter him. Assume the authority which at present lies with others. Surely you can adopt the\\nspirited attitude of that boy and say, „No slave am I!‟ At present, you unhappy creature, slave\\nyou are, slave to your fellow-men, slave to circumstance and slave to life (for life itself is slavery\\nif the courage to die be absent).\\nHave you anything that might induce you to wait? You have exhausted the very pleasures\\nthat make you hesitate and hold you back; not one of them has any novelty for you, not one of\\nthem now fails to bore you out of sheer excess. You know what wine or honey-wine tastes like:\\nit makes no difference whether a hundred or a thousand flagons go through your bladder – all\\nyou are is a strainer. You are perfectly familiar with the taste of oysters or mullet. Your luxurious\\nway of life has kept back not a single fresh experience for you to try in coming years. And yet\\nthese are the things from which you are reluctant to be torn away. What else is there which you\\nwould be sorry to be deprived of? Friends? Do you know how to be a friend? Your country? Do\\nyou really value her so highly that you would put off your dinner for her? The sunlight? If you\\ncould you would put out that light – for what have you ever done that deserved a place in it?\\nConfess it – it is no attachment to the world of politics or business, or even the world of nature,\\nthat makes you put off dying – the delicatessens, in which there is nothing you have left untried,\\nare what you are reluctant to leave. You are scared of death – but how magnificently heedless of\\nit you are while you are dealing with a dish of choice mushrooms! You want to live – but do you\\nknow how to live? You are scared of dying – and, tell me, is the kind of life you lead really any\\ndifferent from being dead? Caligula was once passing a column of captives on the Latin Road\\nwhen one of them, with a hoary old beard reaching down his breast, begged to be put to death.\\n„So,‟ replied Caligula, „you are alive, then, as you are?‟ That is the answer to give to people to\\nwhom death would actually come as a release. „You are scared of dying? So you are alive, then,\\nas you are?‟\\nSomeone, though, will say, „But I want to live because of all the worthy activities I‟m\\nengaged in. I‟m performing life‟s duties conscientiously and energetically and I‟m reluctant to\\nleave them undone.‟ Come now, surely you know that dying is also one of life‟s duties? You‟re\\nleaving no duty undone, for there‟s no fixed number of duties laid down which you‟re supposed\\nto complete. Every life without exception is a short one. Looked at in relation to the universe\\neven the lives of Nestor and Sattia were short. In Sattia, who ordered that her epitaph should\\nrecord that she had lived to the age of ninety-nine, you have an example of someone actually\\nboasting of a prolonged old age – had it so happened that she had lasted out the hundredth year\\neverybody, surely, would have found her quite insufferable! As it is with a play, so it is with life\\n– what matters is not how long the acting lasts, but how good it is. It is not important at what\\npoint you stop. Stop wherever you will – only make sure that you round it off with a good\\nending.\\n\\nLETTER LXXVIII\\n\\n\\x0cI AM all the more sorry to hear of the trouble you are having with constant catarrh, and\\nthe spells of feverishness which go with it when it becomes protracted to the point of being\\nchronic, because this kind of ill health is something I have experienced myself. In its early stages\\nI refused to let it bother me, being still young enough then to adopt a defiant attitude to sickness\\nand put up with hardships, but eventually I succumbed to it altogether. Reduced to a state of\\ncomplete emaciation, I had arrived at a point where the catarrhal discharges were virtually\\ncarrying me away with them altogether. On many an occasion I felt an urge to cut my life short\\nthere and then, and was only held back by the thought of my father, who had been the kindest of\\nfathers to me and was then in his old age. Having in mind not how bravely I was capable of\\ndying but how far from bravely he was capable of bearing the loss, I commanded myself to live.\\nThere are times when even to live is an act of bravery.\\nLet me tell you the things that provided me with consolation in those days, telling you to\\nbegin with that the thoughts which brought me this peace of mind had all the effect of medical\\ntreatment. Comforting thoughts (provided they are not of a discreditable kind) contribute to a\\nperson‟s cure; anything which raises his spirits benefits him physically as well. It was my Stoic\\nstudies that really saved me. For the fact that I was able to leave my bed and was restored to\\nhealth I give the credit to philosophy. I owe her – and it is the least of my obligations to her – my\\nlife. But my friends also made a considerable contribution to my return to health. I found a great\\ndeal of relief in their cheering remarks, in the hours they spent at my bedside and in their\\nconversations with me. There is nothing, my good Lucilius, quite like the devotion of one‟s\\nfriends for supporting one in illness and restoring one to health, or for dispelling one‟s\\nanticipation and dread of death. I even came to feel that I could not really die when these were\\nthe people I would leave surviving me, or perhaps I should say I came to think I would continue\\nto live because of them, if not among them; for it seemed to me that in death I would not be\\npassing away but passing on my spirit to them. These things gave me the willingness to help my\\nown recovery and to endure all the pain. It is quite pathetic, after all, if one has put the will to die\\nbehind one, to be without the will to live.\\nThere, then, are your remedies. The doctor will be telling you how much walking you\\nshould do, how much exercise you should take; he will be telling you not to overdo the inactivity\\n– as is the tendency with invalids – and recommending reading aloud to exercise the breathing\\n(its passages and reservoir being the areas affected); he will recommend that you take a trip by\\nsea and derive some stimulation for the internal organs from the gentle motion of the boat; he\\nwill prescribe a diet for you, and tell you when to make use of wine as a restorative and when to\\ngive it up in case it starts you coughing or aggravates your cough. My own advice to you – and\\nnot only in the present illness but in your whole life as well – is this: refuse to let the thought of\\ndeath bother you: nothing is grim when we have escaped that fear. There are three upsetting\\nthings about any illness: the fear of dying, the physical suffering and the interruption of our\\npleasures. I have said enough about the first, but will just say this, that the fear is due to the facts\\nof nature, not of illness. Illness has actually given many people a new lease of life; the\\nexperience of being near to death has been their preservation. You will die not because you are\\nsick but because you are alive. That end still awaits you when you have been cured. In getting\\nwell again you may be escaping some ill health but not death. Now let us go back and deal with\\nthe disadvantage which really does belong to illness, the fact that it involves considerable\\nphysical torments. These are made bearable by their intermittency. For when pain is at its most\\nsevere the very intensity finds means of ending it. Nobody can be in acute pain and feel it for\\nlong. Nature in her unlimited kindness to us has so arranged things as to make pain either\\n\\n\\x0cbearable or brief. The severest pains have their seat in the most attenuated parts of the body; any\\narea of slight dimensions like a tendon or a joint causes excruciating agony when trouble arises\\nwithin its small confines. But these parts of our anatomy go numb very quickly, the pain itself\\ngiving rise to a loss of all sensation of pain (either because the life force is impaired by being\\nheld up in its natural circulation and so loses its active power, the power which enables it to give\\nus warning of pain, or because the diseased secretions, no longer able to drain away, become\\nself-obliterated and deprive the areas they have congested of sensation). Thus gout in the feet or\\nthe hands or any pain in the vertebrae or tendons has intermittent lulls when it has dulled the area\\nit is torturing; these are all cases in which the distress is caused by the initial twinges and the\\nviolence of the pain disappears as time goes on, the suffering ending in a state of insensibility.\\nThe reason why pain in an eye, an ear or a tooth is exceptionally severe is the fact that it\\ndevelops in a limited area, and indeed this applies just as much to pains in the head; nevertheless\\nif its intensity goes beyond a certain point it is turned into a state of dazed stupefaction. So there\\nis the comforting thing about extremities of pain: if you feel it too much you are bound to stop\\nfeeling it.\\nWhat in fact makes people who are morally unenlightened upset by the experience of\\nphysical distress is their failure to acquire the habit of contentment with the spirit. They have\\ninstead been preoccupied by the body. That is why a man of noble and enlightened character\\nseparates body from spirit and has just as much to do with the former, the frail and complaining\\npart of our nature, as is necessary and no more, and a lot to do with the better, the divine element.\\n„But it‟s hard having to do without pleasures we‟re used to, having to give up food and go thirsty\\nas well as hungry.‟ Tiresome it is in the first stages of abstinence. Later, as the organs of appetite\\ndecline in strength with exhaustion, the cravings die down; thereafter the stomach becomes\\nfussy, unable to stand things it could never have enough of before. The desires themselves die\\naway. And there is nothing harsh about having to do without things for which you have ceased to\\nhave any craving.\\nAnother point is that every pain leaves off altogether, or at least falls off in intensity,\\nfrom time to time. Moreover one can guard against its arrival and employ drugs to forestall it just\\nas it is coming on; for every pain (or at least every pain with a habit of regular recurrence) gives\\none advance warning of its coming. In illness the suffering is always bearable so long as you\\nrefuse to be affected by the ultimate threat.\\nSo do not go out of your way to make your troubles any more tiresome than they are and\\nburden yourself with fretting. Provided that one‟s thinking has not been adding anything to it,\\npain is a trivial sort of thing. If by contrast you start giving yourself encouragement, saying to\\nyourself, „It‟s nothing – or nothing much, anyway – let‟s stick it out, it‟ll be over presently‟, then\\nin thinking it a trivial matter you will be ensuring that it actually is. Everything hangs on one‟s\\nthinking. The love of power or money or luxurious living are not the only things which are\\nguided by popular thinking. We take our cue from people‟s thinking even in the way we feel\\npain.\\nA man is as unhappy as he has convinced himself he is. And complaining away about\\none‟s sufferings after they are over (you know the kind of language: „No one had ever been in\\nsuch a bad state. The torments and hardships I endured! No one thought I would recover. The\\nnumber of times I was given up for lost by the family! The number of times I was despaired of\\nby the doctors! A man on the rack isn‟t torn with pain the way I was‟) is something I think\\nshould be banned. Even if all this is true, it is past history. What‟s the good of dragging up\\nsufferings which are over, of being unhappy now just because you were then? What is more,\\n\\n\\x0cdoesn‟t everyone add a good deal to his tale of hardships and deceive himself as well in the\\nmatter? Besides, there is a pleasure in having succeeded in enduring, something the actual\\nenduring of which was very far from pleasant; when some trouble or other comes to an end the\\nnatural thing is to be glad. There are two things, then, the recollecting of trouble in the past as\\nwell as the fear of troubles to come, that I have to root out: the first is no longer of any concern\\nto me and the second has yet to be so. And when a man is in the grip of difficulties he should say\\nThere may be pleasure in the memory\\nOf even these events one day.*\\nHe should put his whole heart into the fight against them. If he gives way before them he\\nwill lose the battle; if he exerts himself against them he will win. What in fact most people do is\\npull down on their own heads what they should be holding up against; when something is in\\nimminent danger of falling on you, the pressure of it bearing heavily on you, it will only move\\nafter you and become an even greater weight to support if you back away from it; if instead you\\nstand your ground, willing yourself to resist, it will be forced back. Look at the amount of\\npunishment that boxers and wrestlers take to the face and the body generally! They will put up\\nnone the less with any suffering in their desire for fame, and will undergo it all not merely in the\\ncourse of fighting but in preparing for their fights as well: their training in itself constitutes\\nsuffering. Let us too overcome all things, with our reward consisting not in any wreath or\\ngarland, not in trumpet-calls for silence for the ceremonial proclamation of our name, but in\\nmoral worth, in strength of spirit, in a peace that is won for ever once in any contest fortune has\\nbeen utterly defeated.\\n„I‟m suffering severe pain,‟ you may say. Well does it stop you suffering it if you endure\\nit in a womanish fashion? In the same way as the enemy can do far more damage to your army if\\nit is in full retreat, every trouble that may come our way presses harder on the one who has\\nturned tail and is giving ground. „But it‟s really severe.‟ Well, is courage only meant to enable us\\nto bear up under what is not severe? Would you rather have an illness that‟s long drawn out or\\none that‟s short and quick? If it‟s a long one it will have the odd interval, giving one opportunity\\nfor rallying, granting one a good deal of time free of it, having of necessity to pause in order to\\nbuild up again. An illness that‟s swift and short will have one of two results: either oneself or it\\nwill be snuffed out. And what difference does it make whether I or it disappears? Either way\\nthere‟s an end to the pain.\\nAnother thing which will help is to turn your mind to other thoughts and that way get\\naway from your suffering. Call to mind things which you have done that have been upright or\\ncourageous; run over in your mind the finest parts that you have played. And cast your memory\\nover the things you have most admired; this is a time for recollecting all those individuals of\\nexceptional courage who have triumphed over pain: the man who steadily went on reading a\\nbook while he was having varicose veins cut out: the man who never stopped smiling under\\ntorture albeit that this angered his tormentors into trying on him every instrument of cruelty they\\nhad. If pain has been conquered by a smile will it not be conquered by reason? And here you\\nmay mention anything you care to name, catarrh, a fit of uninterrupted coughing so violent that it\\nbrings up parts of the internal organs, having one‟s very entrails seared by a fever, thirst, having\\nlimbs wrenched in different directions with dislocation of the joints, or – worse than these –\\nbeing stretched on the rack or burnt alive, or subjected to the red-hot plates and instruments\\ndesigned to re-open and deepen swelling wounds. There have been men who have undergone\\nthese experiences and never uttered a groan. „He needs more, he hasn‟t asked for mercy… he\\nneeds more, he still hasn‟t answered… he needs more, he has actually smiled, and not a forced\\n\\n\\x0csmile either.‟ Surely pain is something you will want to smile at after this.\\n„But my illness has taken me away from my duties and won‟t allow me to achieve\\nanything.‟ It is your body, not your mind as well, that is in the grip of ill health. Hence it may\\nslow the feet of a runner and make the hands of a smith or cobbler less efficient, but if your mind\\nis by habit of an active turn you may still give instruction and advice, listen and learn, inquire\\nand remember. Besides, if you meet sickness in a sensible manner, do you really think you are\\nachieving nothing? You will be demonstrating that even if one cannot always beat it one can\\nalways bear an illness. There is room for heroism, I assure you, in bed as anywhere else. War and\\nthe battle-front are not the only spheres in which proof is to be had of a spirited and fearless\\ncharacter: a person‟s bravery is no less evident under the bed-clothes. There is something it lies\\nopen to you to achieve, and that is making the fight with illness a good one. If its threats or\\nimportunities leave you quite unmoved, you are setting others a signal example. How much\\nscope there would be for renown if whenever we were sick we had an audience of spectators! Be\\nyour own spectator anyway, your own applauding audience.\\nPleasures, moreover, are of two kinds. The physical pleasures are the ones which illness\\ninterferes with, though it does not do away with them altogether – indeed, if you take a true view\\nof the matter, they are actually sharpened by illness, a man deriving greater pleasure from\\ndrinking something when he is thirsty and finding food all the more welcome through being\\nhungry, anything set before one after one has had to fast being greeted with a heightened\\nappetite. But no doctor can refuse his patient those other, greater and surer pleasures, the\\npleasures of the mind and spirit. Anyone who follows these and genuinely knows them pays no\\nattention whatever to all the enticements of the senses. „How very unfortunate he is,‟ people say,\\n„to be sick like that!‟ Why? Because he isn‟t melting snow in his wine? Because he isn‟t\\nbreaking ice into a bumper goblet to keep the drink he has mixed in it chilled? Because Lucrine\\noysters aren‟t being opened before him at his table? Because there isn‟t any bustling of cooks\\nabout the dining-room, bringing in not just the viands themselves but the actual cooking\\napparatus along with them? For this is the latest innovation in luxurious living, having the\\nkitchen accompany the dinner in to the table so as to prevent any of the food losing its heat and\\navoid anything being at a temperature insufficiently scalding for palates which are nowadays like\\nleather. „How very unfortunate he is to be sick,‟ they say. In fact he‟ll be eating just as much as\\nhe‟ll digest. There won‟t be a whole boar lying somewhere where people can see it, conveying\\nthe impression that it has been banished from the table as being too cheap and ordinary a piece of\\nmeat to be on it, nor will he have his trolley piled high with – now that people think it not quite\\nnice to see the whole bird – carved breast of fowl. And what‟s so bad about your being deprived\\nof that? You may be eating like a sick man, but you‟ll at last be eating in the way a healthy man\\nshould.\\nBut given one thing we shall find it easy to put up with the potions and warm drinks and\\nall the rest of it – all the things that seem unbearable to people who have become spoilt, who\\nhave become soft through a life of luxury, ailing more in the mind than they ever are in the body;\\nthe one requirement is that we cease to dread death. And so we shall as soon as we have learnt to\\ndistinguish the good things and the bad things in this world. Then and then only shall we stop\\nbeing weary of living as well as scared of dying. For a life spent viewing all the variety, the\\nmajesty, the sublimity in things around us can never succumb to ennui: the feeling that one is\\ntired of being, of existing, is usually the result of an idle and inactive leisure. Truth will never\\npall on someone who explores the world of nature, wearied as a person will be by the spurious\\nthings. Moreover, even if death is on the way with a summons for him, though it come all too\\n\\n\\x0cearly, though it cut him off in the prime of life, he has experienced every reward that the very\\nlongest life can offer, having gained extensive knowledge of the world we live in, having learnt\\nthat time adds nothing to the finer things in life. Whereas any life must needs seem short to\\npeople who measure it in terms of pleasures which through their empty nature are incapable of\\ncompleteness.\\nLet these reflections promote your recovery, and meanwhile do find time for our\\ncorrespondence. Time will bring us together again one of these days; and when, as it will, the\\nreunion comes, however short it may last, knowing how to make the most of it will turn it into a\\nlong one. As Posidonius said, „In a single day there lies open to men of learning more than there\\never does to the unenlightened in the longest of lifetimes.‟ In the meantime cling tooth and nail\\nto the following rule: not to give in to adversity, never to trust prosperity, and always take full\\nnote of fortune‟s habit of behaving just as she pleases, treating her as if she were actually going\\nto do everything it is in her power to do. Whatever you have been expecting for some time\\ncomes as less of a shock.\\n\\nLETTER LXXXIII\\nYOU demand an account of my days – generally as well as individually. You think well\\nof me if you suppose that there is nothing in them for me to hide. And we should, indeed, live as\\nif we were in public view, and think, too, as if someone could peer into the inmost recesses of\\nour hearts – which someone can! For what is to be gained if something is concealed from man\\nwhen nothing is barred from God? He is present in our minds, in attendance in the midst of our\\nthoughts – although by „attendance‟ I do not mean to suggest that he is not at times absent from\\nour thoughts. I shall do as you say, then, and gladly give you a record of what I do and in what\\norder. I shall put myself under observation straight away and undertake a review of my day – a\\ncourse which is of the utmost benefit. What really ruins our characters is the fact that none of us\\nlooks back over his life. We think about what we are going to do, and only rarely of that, and fail\\nto think about what we have done, yet any plans for the future are dependent on the past.\\nToday has been unbroken. No one has robbed me of any part of it. It has been wholly\\ndivided between my bed and my reading. A very small part of it has been given over to physical\\nexercise – and on this account I‟m grateful for old age, for the exercise costs me little trouble. I\\nonly have to stir and I‟m weary, and that after all is the end of exercise even for the strongest.\\nInterested in having my trainers? One‟s enough for me – Pharius, a likeable young fellow, as you\\nknow, but he‟s due for a change. I‟m looking now for someone rather more youthful. He in fact\\ndeclares that we‟re both at the same climacteric since we‟re both losing our teeth. But I‟ve\\nreached the stage where I can only keep up with him with difficulty when we‟re out for a run,\\nand before many days are out I won‟t be able to keep up with him at all. See what daily exercise\\ndoes for one. When two people are going in opposite directions there‟s soon a big distance\\nbetween them: he‟s coming up at the same time as I‟m going downwards, and you know how\\nmuch quicker travel is in the second of these directions. But I‟m wrong: the age I‟m at isn‟t one\\nthat is „going downwards‟ – it‟s one that‟s in headlong descent.\\nHowever, you‟d like to hear how today‟s race ended? Well, we made it a tie, something\\nthat doesn‟t often happen with runners. After this, more a spell of exhaustion than of exercise, I\\nhad a cold plunge – cold, with me, meaning just short of warm! Here I am, once celebrated as a\\ndevotee of cold baths, regularly paying my respects to the Canal on the first of January and\\njumping into the Maiden Pool in just the same way as I read, wrote and spoke some sentence or\\nother every New Year in order to ensure good luck in the coming year; and now I‟ve shifted my\\n\\n\\x0cscene of operations, first to the Tiber, then to my own pool here, which, even when I‟m feeling\\nmy heartiest and don‟t cheat, has had the chill taken off it by the sun; it‟s a short step to a hot\\nbath! The next thing is breakfast, which consists of some dry bread; no table laid, and no need to\\nwash the hands after such a meal. I then have the briefest of naps. You know this habit of mine,\\nof dropping off for a moment or two, just slipping off the harness, as you might say. I find it\\nenough to have simply stopped being awake. Sometimes I know I‟ve been asleep, sometimes\\nmerely guess I have been….*\\nZeno was a very great man as well as the founder of our Stoic school, a school with an\\nunequalled record for courageous and saintly living; well, listen to the way in which, desiring to\\ndeter us from drunkenness, he deduces the principle that the good man won‟t get drunk. „No\\nperson who is drunk,‟ he says, „is entrusted with a secret: the good man is entrusted with a secret:\\ntherefore, the good man will not get drunk.‟ Watch how ridiculous he‟s made to look when we\\ncounter with a single syllogism on the same pattern (of the many we could advance it‟s sufficient\\nto instance one). „No person who is asleep is entrusted with a secret: the good man is entrusted\\nwith a secret: therefore, the good man does not go to sleep….‟\\nNow just let each of us name for himself the people he knows can be trusted with a secret\\nthough they can‟t be trusted with a bottle. I‟ll give, all the same, one solitary example myself,\\njust to prevent its being lost to human memory! Life needs a stock of noteworthy examples; nor\\nneed we always go running to antiquity for them. Lucius Piso was drunk from the very moment\\nof his appointment as Warden of the City of Rome. He regularly spent most of the night wining\\nand dining in company, and slept from then until around midday, noon to him being early\\nmorning; he nevertheless discharged his duties, which embraced the general welfare of the whole\\ncity, with the utmost efficiency. The late emperor Augustus as well as Tiberius entrusted him\\nwith secret orders, the former on appointing him governor of Thrace (the conquest of which he\\ncompleted), the latter when he left Rome for Campania, leaving behind him in the capital many\\nobjects of distrust and hostility. I imagine it was because Piso‟s drunken habits had been such a\\nsuccess so far as he was concerned that Tiberius later appointed Cossus to be Prefect of the City.\\nThis man, otherwise dignified and self-controlled, steeped himself in liquor, soaking it up to such\\nan extent that on one occasion in the Senate, having come there straight from a party, he\\nsuccumbed to a slumber from which nothing could rouse him and had to be carried out. Yet this\\ndid not stop Tiberius writing (in his own hand) a number of letters to Cossus the contents of\\nwhich he did not consider suitable for communication even to his ministers; and Cossus never let\\nslip a single secret, whether private or official….\\nIf you want to arrive at the conclusion that the good man ought not to get drunk, why set\\nabout it with syllogisms? Tell people how disgusting it is for a man to pump more into himself\\nthan he can hold and not to know the capacity of his own stomach. Tell them of all the things\\nmen do that they would blush at sober, and that drunkenness is nothing but a state of self-induced\\ninsanity. For imagine the drunken man‟s behaviour extended over several days: would you\\nhesitate to think him out of his mind? As it is, the difference is simply one of duration, not of\\ndegree. Point to the example of Alexander of Macedon, stabbing his dearest and truest friend,\\nClitus, at a banquet, and wanting to die, as indeed he should have done, when he realized the\\nenormity of what he had done. Drunkenness inflames and lays bare every vice, removing the\\nreserve that acts as a check on impulses to wrong behaviour. For people abstain from forbidden\\nthings far more often through feelings of inhibition when it comes to doing what is wrong than\\nthrough any will to good…. Add to this the drunkard‟s ignorance of his situation, his indistinct,\\nuncertain speech, his inability to walk straight, his unsteady eye and swimming head, with his\\n\\n\\x0cvery home in a state of motion – as if the whole house had been set spinning by some cyclone –\\nand the tortures in his stomach as the wine ferments….\\nWhere is the glory in mere capacity? When the victory rests with you, when all the\\ncompany lie prostrate around you, slumbering or vomiting, declining all your calls for another\\ntoast, when you find yourself the only person at the party still on your feet, when your mighty\\nprowess has enabled you to beat all comers and no one has proved able to match your intake, a\\nbarrel is none the less enough to beat you.\\nWhat else was it but drinking to excess, together with a passion for Cleopatra itself as\\npotent as drink, that ruined that great and gifted man, Mark Antony, dragging him down into\\nforeign ways of living and un-Roman vices? This it was that made him an enemy of the state;\\nthis is what made him no match for his enemies; it was this that made him cruel, having the\\nheads of his country‟s leading men brought in to him at the dinner-table, identifying the hands\\nand features of liquidated opponents in the course of banquets marked by sumptuous\\nmagnificence and regal pomp, still thirsting for blood when filled to the full with wine….\\nExplain, then, why the good man should avoid getting drunk, using facts, not words, to\\nshow its ugliness and offensiveness. Prove – and an easy task it is – that so-called pleasures,\\nwhen they go beyond a certain limit, are but punishments….\\n\\nLETTER LXXXVI\\nHERE I am, staying at the country house which once belonged to Scipio of Africa\\nhimself. I am writing after paying my respects to his departed spirit as well as to an altar which I\\nrather think may be the actual tomb of that great soldier. His soul will have gone to heaven,\\nreturned in fact to the place from which it came. What convinces me of this is not the size of the\\narmies he commanded – for Cambyses equally had such armies and Cambyses was merely a\\nmadman who turned his madness to good account – but his quite exceptional self-restraint and\\nsense of duty. This is something in him which I find even more deserving of admiration at the\\ntime when he finally left his country than during the time when he was fighting for her. Was\\nScipio to stay in Rome? Or was Rome to stay a free democracy? That was then the choice. What\\ndid Scipio say? „I have no wish‟ he said, „to have the effect of weakening in the least degree our\\nlaws or institutions. All Roman citizens must be equal before the law. I ask my country, then, to\\nmake the most of what I have done for her, but without me. If she owes it to me that she is today\\na free country, let me also prove that she is free. If my stature has grown too great for her best\\ninterests, then out I go.‟ Am I not justified in admiring that nobility of character which led him to\\nretire, to go into voluntary exile to relieve the state of an embarrassing burden? Events had come\\nto the point where either Scipio or democracy was going to suffer at the other‟s hands. Neither of\\nthese two things could justly be permitted to happen. So he gave way to her constitution and,\\nproposing that the nation should be no less indebted to him for his absence from the scene than\\nfor Hannibal‟s, he went off into retirement at Liternum.\\nI have seen the house, which is built of squared stone blocks; the wall surrounding the\\npark; and the towers built out on both sides of the house for purposes of defence; the well,\\nconcealed among the greenery and out-buildings, with sufficient water to provide for the needs\\nof a whole army; and the tiny little bath, situated after the old-fashioned custom in an ill-lit\\ncorner, our ancestors believing that the only place where one could properly have a hot bath was\\nin the dark. It was this which started in my mind reflections that occasioned me a good deal of\\nenjoyment as I compared Scipio‟s way of life and our own. In this corner the famous Terror of\\nCarthage, to whom Rome owes it that she has only once* in her history been captured, used to\\n\\n\\x0cwash a body weary from work on the farm! For he kept himself fit through toil, cultivating his\\nfields by his own labour, as was the regular way in the old days. And this was the ceiling, dingy\\nin the extreme, under which he stood; and this the equally undistinguished paving that carried his\\nweight.\\nWho is there who could bear to have a bath in such surroundings nowadays? We think\\nourselves poorly off, living like paupers, if the walls are not ablaze with large and costly circular\\nmirrors, if our Alexandrian marbles are not decorated with panels of Numidian marble, if the\\nwhole of their surface has not been given a decorative overlay of elaborate patterns having all the\\nvariety of fresco murals, unless the ceiling cannot be seen for glass, unless the pools into which\\nwe lower bodies with all the strength drained out of them by lengthy periods in the sweating\\nroom are edged with Thasian marble (which was once the rarest of sights even in a temple),\\nunless the water pours from silver taps. And so far we have only been talking about the ordinary\\nfellow‟s plumbing. What about the bath-houses of certain former slaves? Look at their arrays of\\nstatues, their assemblies of columns that do not support a thing but are put up purely for\\nornament, just for the sake of spending money. Look at the cascades of water splashing noisily\\ndown from one level to the next. We have actually come to such a pitch of choosiness that we\\nobject to walking on anything other than precious stones.\\nIn this bathroom of Scipio‟s there are tiny chinks – you could hardly call them windows –\\npierced in the masonry of the wall in such a way as to let in light without in any way weakening\\nits defensive character. Nowadays „moth-hole‟ is the way some people speak of a bathroom\\nunless it has been designed to catch the sun through enormous windows all day long, unless a\\nperson can acquire a tan at the same time as he is having a bath, unless he has views from the\\nbath over countryside and sea.\\nThe result is that bath-houses which drew admiring crowds when they were first opened\\nare actually dismissed as antiquated as soon as extravagance has hit on any novelty calculated to\\nput its own best previous efforts in the shade. There was a time when bath-houses were few and\\nfar between, and never in the least luxuriously appointed – and why should they have been,\\nconsidering that they were designed for use, not for diversion, and that admission only cost you a\\ncopper? There were no showers in those days, and the water did not come in a continuous gush\\nas if from a hot spring. People did not think it mattered then how clear the water was in which\\nthey were going to get rid of the dirt. Heavens, what a pleasure it is to go into one of those\\nhalf-lit bath-houses with their ordinary plastered ceilings, where you knew that Cato himself as\\naedile – or Fabius Maximus, or one of the Cornelii – regulated the warmth of your water with his\\nown hand! For, however high their rank, it was one of the duties of the aediles to enter all such\\npremises as were open to the public and enforce standards of cleanliness and a healthy sort of\\ntemperature, sufficient for practical purposes, not the kind of heat which has recently come into\\nfashion, more like that of a furnace – so much so indeed that a slave convicted on a criminal\\ncharge might well be sentenced to be bathed alive! There doesn‟t seem to me to be any\\ndifference now between „your bath‟s warm‟ and „your bath‟s boiling‟.\\n„How primitive!‟ Such is some people‟s verdict these days on Scipio because he did not\\nhave extensive areas of glass to let the daylight into the perspiring room, because it was not a\\nhabit with him to stew in strong sunlight, letting the time go by until he was perfectly cooked in\\nhis own bathroom. „What a sorry wretch of a man! He didn‟t know how to live! He‟d take his\\nbath in water that was never filtered and often cloudy, practically muddy in fact after any heavy\\nrain.‟ Well, it did not make much difference to Scipio if this was the kind of bath he had; he went\\nthere to wash off sweat, not scent. And what do you think some people will say to this? „Well, I\\n\\n\\x0cdon‟t envy Scipio; if that was the kind of bath he had all the time, it was a real exile‟s life that he\\nwas leading.‟\\nYes, and what‟s more, if you must know, he didn‟t even have a bath every day. Writers\\nwho have left us a record of life in ancient Rome tell us that it was just their arms and legs,\\nwhich of course they dirtied working, that people washed every day, bathing all over only once a\\nweek on market day. „Obviously,‟ someone will comment, „there must have been times when\\nthey were positively disgusting.‟ And what do you think they stank of? I‟ll tell you – of hard\\nsoldiering, of hard work, of all that goes to make up a man. Men are dirtier creatures now than\\nthey ever were in the days before the coming of spotlessly clean bathrooms. What is it Horace\\nsays when he wants to describe a man noted and indeed notorious for the inordinate lengths to\\nwhich he carried personal fastidiousness?\\nBucillus stinks of scented lozenges.*\\nProduce Bucillus today and he might just as well „stink like a goat‟. He would be in the\\nsame position as the Gargonius with whom Horace contrasted him. For nowadays it is not even\\nenough to use some scented ointment – it must be reapplied two or three times a day as a\\nprecaution against its evaporation on the person. I say nothing about the way people preen\\nthemselves on the perfume it carries, as if it were their own.\\nIf all this strikes you as being excessively disapproving you must put it down to the\\nhouse‟s atmosphere! During my stay in it I‟ve learnt from Aegialus (who‟s the present owner of\\nthe estate, and gives a great deal of attention to its management) that trees can be transplanted\\neven when quite old – a lesson that we old men need to learn when we reckon that every one of\\nus who puts down a new olive plantation is doing so for someone else‟s benefit – now that I‟ve\\nseen him carefully transplanting one of a number of trees that had given fruit unstintingly over\\nthree and even four seasons. So you too can enjoy the shade of the tree which\\nIs slow in coming up, is there to give\\nYour grandsons shade in later years, long hence,*\\naccording to our Virgil, who was not concerned with the facts but with poetic effect, his\\nobject being the pleasure of the reader, not the instruction of the farmer. To pick out only one\\nexample, let me quote the following passage which I felt compelled to find fault with today.\\nIn Spring‟s the time for sowing beans; then, too,\\nThe crumbling furrows, Clover, welcome you,\\nAnd millet, too, receives her yearly care.†\\nI leave you to conclude from this whether the crops mentioned are to be planted at the\\nsame time as each other, and whether in each case they‟re to be sown in spring. As I write, it‟s\\nJune, getting on for July now, too, and I‟ve seen people harvesting beans and sowing millet on\\nthe same day.\\nTo get back to our olive plantation, I saw two different methods of planting used here. In\\nthe first, taking sizeable trees and lopping off the branches, cutting them back to a foot from the\\nstem, Aegialus transplanted them complete with crown, pruning away the roots and leaving only\\nthe actual base, the part to which the roots are attached. This he placed in the hole with an\\napplication of manure, and not only earthed it in but trod and stamped the soil down hard. He\\nsays that nothing gives such good results as this „packing them down‟, as he calls it; what it does,\\nof course, is to keep out cold and wind; and apart from that, the tree is less liable to be shifted,\\nthus allowing the young roots to sprout and get a grip on the soil when they are inevitably tender\\nand torn from their precarious holds by the slightest disturbance. He also scrapes the crown of\\nthe tree before covering it up, because (he says) new roots emerge wherever the wood\\n\\n\\x0cunderneath has been laid bare. The tree, again, should not stand higher than three or four feet\\nabove the ground. This will ensure, right from the start, green growth from the bottom upwards\\ninstead of a large area of dry and withered stem of the sort one sees in old olive-groves.\\nThe second method was as follows: taking branches of the type one normally finds on\\nvery young trees, strong but at the same time having soft bark, he planted them out in the same\\nsort of way. These grow rather more slowly but since they spring from what is virtually a cutting,\\nthere is nothing scraggy or unsightly about them.\\nAnother thing I‟ve seen is the transplanting of an old vine from its supporting tree; in this\\ncase, one has to gather up with it, if possible, even the minute root-hairs, and in addition give it a\\nmore generous covering of soil so that it throws out roots from the stem as well. I have seen such\\nplantings not only in the month of February but even at the end of March, the vines going on to\\nembrace and take good hold of their new elm trees. Aegialus also says that all trees which are\\nstout in the stem, if one may so term them, should have the benefit of a supply of water stored in\\ntanks; if this is a success, we have brought the rain under our control.\\nBut I don‟t propose to tell you any more, in case I turn you into a rival grower in the\\nsame way as Aegialus has turned me into a competitor of his!\\n\\n\\x0cLETTER LXXXVIII\\nYOU want to know my attitude towards liberal studies. Well, I have no respect for any\\nstudy whatsoever if its end is the making of money. Such studies are to me unworthy ones. They\\ninvolve the putting out of skills to hire, and are only of value in so far as they may develop the\\nmind without occupying it for long. Time should be spent on them only so long as one‟s mental\\nabilities are not up to dealing with higher things. They are our apprenticeship, not our real work.\\nWhy „liberal studies‟ are so called is obvious: it is because they are the ones considered worthy\\nof a free man.* But there is really only one liberal study that deserves the name – because it\\nmakes a person free – and that is the pursuit of wisdom. Its high ideals, its steadfastness and\\nspirit make all other studies puerile and puny in comparison. Do you really think there is\\nanything to be said for the others when you find among the people who profess to teach them\\nquite the most reprehensible and worthless characters you could have as teachers? All right to\\nhave studied that sort of thing once, but not to be studying them now.\\nThe question has sometimes been posed whether these liberal studies make a man a better\\nperson. But in fact they do not aspire to any knowledge of how to do this, let alone claim to do it.\\nLiterary scholarship concerns itself with research into language, or history if a rather broader\\nfield is preferred, or, extending its range to the very limit, poetry. Which of these paves the way\\nto virtue? Attentiveness to words, analysis of syllables, accounts of myths, laying down the\\nprinciples of prosody? What is there in all this that dispels fear, roots out desire or reins in\\npassion? Or let us take a look at music, at geometry; you will not find anything in them which\\ntells us not to be afraid of this or desire that – and if anyone lacks this kind of knowledge all his\\nother knowledge is valueless to him. The question is whether or not that sort of scholar is\\nteaching virtue. For if he is not, he will not even be imparting it incidentally. If he is teaching it\\nhe is a philosopher. If you really want to know how far these persons are from the position of\\nbeing moral teachers, observe the absence of connexion between all the things they study; if they\\nwere teaching one and the same thing a connexion would be evident. Unless perhaps they\\nmanage to persuade you that Homer was actually a philosopher – though they refute their case by\\nmeans of the very passages which lead them to infer it. For at one moment they make him a\\nStoic, giving nothing but virtue his approval, steering clear of pleasure, not even an offer of\\nimmortality inducing him to stoop to the dishonourable; at another they make him an Epicurean,\\npraising the way of life of a society passing its days at peace and ease, in an atmosphere of\\ndinner-parties and music-making; at another he becomes a Peripatetic, with a threefold\\nclassification of things good; at another an Academic, stating that nothing is certain. It is obvious\\nthat none of these philosophies is to be found in Homer for the very reason that they all are, the\\ndoctrines being mutually incompatible. Even suppose we grant these people that Homer was a\\nphilosopher, he became a wise man, surely, before he could recite any epics, so that what we\\nshould be learning are the things which made him wise. And there is no more point in my\\ninvestigating which was the earlier, Homer or Hesiod, than there would be in my knowing the\\nreason why Hecuba, though younger than Helen, carried her years so unsuccessfully. And what, I\\nwould ask this kind of scholar, do you suppose is the point of trying to establish the ages of\\nPatroclus and Achilles? And are you more concerned to find out where Ulysses‟ wanderings took\\nhim than to find a way of putting an end to our own perpetual wanderings? We haven‟t the time\\nto spare to hear whether it was between Italy and Sicily that he ran into a storm or somewhere\\noutside the area of the world we know – wanderings as extensive as his could never in fact have\\ntaken place inside so limited an area – when every day we‟re running into our own storms,\\n\\n\\x0cspiritual storms, and driven by vice into all the troubles that Ulysses ever knew. We‟re not spared\\nthose eye-distracting beauties, or attackers. We too have to contend in various places with savage\\nmonsters revelling in human blood, insidious voices that beguile our ears, shipwrecks and all\\nmanner of misfortune. What you should be teaching me is how I may attain such a love for my\\ncountry, my father and my wife, and keep on course for those ideals even after shipwreck. Why\\ngo into the question whether or not Penelope completely took in her contemporaries and was far\\nfrom being a model of wifely purity, any more than the question whether or not she had a feeling\\nthat the man she was looking at was Ulysses before she actually knew it? Teach me instead what\\npurity is, how much value there is in it, whether it lies in the body or in the mind.\\nTurning to the musical scholar I say this. You teach me how bass and treble harmonize,\\nor how strings producing different notes can give rise to concord. I would rather you brought\\nabout some harmony in my mind and got my thoughts into tune. You show me which are the\\nplaintive keys. I would rather you showed me how to avoid uttering plaintive notes when things\\ngo against me in life.\\nThe geometrician teaches me how to work out the size of my estates – rather than how to\\nwork out how much a man needs in order to have enough. He teaches me to calculate, putting my\\nfingers into the service of avarice, instead of teaching me that there is no point whatsoever in that\\nsort of computation and that a person is none the happier for having properties which tire\\naccountants out, or to put it another way, how superfluous a man‟s possessions are when he\\nwould be a picture of misery if you forced him to start counting up single-handed how much he\\npossessed. What use is it to me to be able to divide a piece of land into equal areas if I‟m unable\\nto divide it with a brother? What use is the ability to measure out a portion of an acre with an\\naccuracy extending even to the bits which elude the measuring rod if I‟m upset when some\\nhigh-handed neighbour encroaches slightly on my property? The geometrician teaches me how I\\nmay avoid losing any fraction of my estates, but what I really want to learn is how to lose the lot\\nand still keep smiling. „But I‟m being turned off the land my father and grandfather owned\\nbefore me! „Well, so what? Who owned the land before your grandfather? Are you in a position\\nto identify the community, let alone the individual, to whom it originally belonged? You entered\\non it as a tenant, not an absolute owner. Whose tenant, you may ask? Your heir‟s, and that only if\\nyou‟re lucky. The legal experts say that acquisition by prescription never applies where the\\nproperty concerned is actually public property. Well, what you possess and call your own is\\nreally public property, or mankind‟s property for that matter. Oh, the marvels of geometry! You\\ngeometers can calculate the areas of circles, can reduce any given shape to a square, can state the\\ndistances separating stars. Nothing‟s outside your scope when it comes to measurement. Well, if\\nyou‟re such an expert, measure a man‟s soul; tell me how large or how small that is. You can\\ndefine a straight line; what use is that to you if you‟ve no idea what straightness means in life?\\nI come now to the person who prides himself on his familiarity with the heavenly bodies:\\nTowards which quarter chilly Saturn draws,\\nThe orbits in which burning Mercury roams.*\\nWhat is to be gained from this sort of knowledge? Am I supposed to feel anxious when\\nSaturn and Mars are in opposition or Mercury sets in the evening in full view of Saturn, instead\\nof coming to learn that bodies like these are equally propitious wherever they are, and incapable\\nof change in any case. They are swept on in a path from which they cannot escape, their motion\\ngoverned by an uninterrupted sequence of destined events, making their reappearances in cycles\\nthat are fixed. They either actuate or signalize all that comes about in the universe. If every event\\nis brought about by them, how is mere familiarity with a process which is unchangeable going to\\n\\n\\x0cbe of any help? If they are pointers to events, what difference does it make to be aware in\\nadvance of things you cannot escape? They are going to happen whether you know about them\\nor not.\\nIf you observe the hasting sun and watch\\nThe stars processing through the skies, the day\\nThat follows will not prove you wrong; nor will\\nDeceptive cloudfree nights then take you in.*\\nI‟ve taken sufficient precautions, more than sufficient precautions, to ensure that I‟m not\\ntaken in by deceptive phenomena. At this you‟ll protest: „Can you really say “the day that\\nfollows never proves me wrong”? Surely anything that happens which one didn‟t know in\\nadvance was going to happen proves one wrong?‟ Well, I don‟t know what‟s going to happen;\\nbut I do know what‟s capable of happening – and none of this will give rise to any protest on my\\npart. I‟m ready for everything. If I‟m let off in any way, I‟m pleased. The day in question proves\\nme wrong in a sense if it treats me leniently, but even so not really wrong, for just as I know that\\nanything is capable of happening so also do I know that it‟s not bound to happen. So I look for\\nthe best and am prepared for the opposite.\\nYou‟ll have to bear with me if I digress here. Nothing will induce me to accept painters\\ninto the list of liberal arts, any more than sculptors, marble-masons and all the other attendants\\non extravagance. I must equally reject those oil and dust practitioners, the wrestlers, or else I\\nshall have to include in the list the perfumers and cooks and all the others who place their talents\\nat the service of our pleasures. What is there, I ask you, that‟s liberal about those characters who\\nvomit up their food to empty their stomachs for more, with their bodies stuffed full and their\\nminds all starved and inactive? Can we possibly look on this as a liberal accomplishment for the\\nyouth of Rome, whom our ancestors trained to stand up straight and throw a javelin, to toss the\\ncaber, and manage a horse, and handle weapons? They never used to teach their children\\nanything which could be learned in a reclining posture. That kind of training, nevertheless,\\ndoesn‟t teach or foster moral values any more than the other. What‟s the use, after all, of\\nmastering a horse and controlling him with the reins at full gallop if you‟re carried away yourself\\nby totally unbridled emotions? What‟s the use of overcoming opponent after opponent in the\\nwrestling or boxing rings if you can be overcome by your temper?\\n„So we don‟t,‟ you may ask, „in fact gain anything from the liberal studies?‟ As far as\\ncharacter is concerned, no, but we gain a good deal from them in other directions – just as even\\nthese admittedly inferior arts which we‟ve been talking about, the ones that are based on use of\\nthe hands, make important contributions to the amenities of life although they have nothing to do\\nwith character. Why then do we give our sons a liberal education? Not because it can make them\\nmorally good but because it prepares the mind for the acquisition of moral values. Just as that\\ngrounding in grammar, as they called it in the old days, in which boys are given their elementary\\nschooling, does not teach them the liberal arts but prepares the ground for knowledge of them in\\ndue course, so when it comes to character the liberal arts open the way to it rather than carry the\\npersonality all the way there….*\\nIn this connexion I feel prompted to take a look at individual qualities of character.\\nBravery is the one which treats with contempt things ordinarily inspiring fear, despising and\\ndefying and demolishing all the things that terrify us and set chains on human freedom. Is she in\\nany way fortified by liberal studies? Take loyalty, the most sacred quality that can be found in a\\nhuman breast, never corrupted by a bribe, never driven to betray by any form of compulsion,\\ncrying: „Beat me, burn me, put me to death, I shall not talk – the more the torture probes my\\n\\n\\x0csecrets the deeper I‟ll hide them! „Can liberal studies create that kind of spirit? Take self-control,\\nthe quality which takes command of the pleasures; some she dismisses out of hand, unable to\\ntolerate them; others she merely regulates, ensuring that they are brought within healthy limits;\\nnever approaching pleasures for their own sake, she realizes that the ideal limit with things you\\ndesire is not the amount you would like to but the amount you ought to take. Humanity is the\\nquality which stops one being arrogant towards one‟s fellows, or being acrimonious. In words, in\\nactions, in emotions she reveals herself as kind and good-natured towards all. To her the troubles\\nof anyone else are her own, and anything that benefits herself she welcomes primarily because it\\nwill be of benefit to someone else. Do the liberal studies inculcate these attitudes? No, no more\\nthan they do simplicity, or modesty and restraint, or frugality and thrift, or mercy, the mercy that\\nis as sparing with another‟s blood as though it were its own, knowing that it is not for man to\\nmake wasteful use of man.\\nSomeone will ask me how I can say that liberal studies are of no help towards morality\\nwhen I‟ve just been saying that there‟s no attaining morality without them. My answer would be\\nthis: there‟s no attaining morality without food either, but there‟s no connexion between morality\\nand food. The fact that a ship can‟t begin to exist without the timbers of which it‟s built doesn‟t\\nmean that the timbers are of „help‟ to it. There‟s no reason for you to assume that, X being\\nsomething without which Y could never have come about, Y came about as a result of the\\nassistance of X. And indeed it can actually be argued that the attainment of wisdom is perfectly\\npossible without the liberal studies; although moral values are things which have to be learnt,\\nthey are not learnt through these studies. Besides, what grounds could I possibly have for\\nsupposing that a person who has no acquaintance with books will never be a wise man? For\\nwisdom does not lie in books. Wisdom publishes not words but truths – and I‟m not sure that the\\nmemory isn‟t more reliable when it has no external aids to fall back on.\\nThere is nothing small or cramped about wisdom. It is something calling for a lot of room\\nto move. There are questions to be answered concerning physical as well as human matters,\\nquestions about the past and about the future, questions about things eternal and things\\nephemeral, questions about time itself. On this one subject of time just look how many questions\\nthere are. To start with, does it have an existence of its own? Next, does anything exist prior to\\ntime, independently of it? Did it begin with the universe, or did it exist even before then on the\\ngrounds that there was something in existence before the universe? There are countless questions\\nabout the soul alone – where it comes from, what its nature is, when it begins to exist, and how\\nlong it is in existence; whether it passes from one place to another, moving house, so to speak, on\\ntransfer to successive living creatures, taking on a different form with each, or is no more than\\nonce in service and is then released to roam the universe; whether it is a corporeal substance or\\nnot; what it will do when it ceases to act through us, how it will employ its freedom once it has\\nescaped its cage here; whether it will forget its past and become conscious of its real nature from\\nthe actual moment of its parting from the body and departure for its new home on high.\\nWhatever the field of physical or moral sciences you deal with, you will be given no rest by the\\nmass of things to be learnt or investigated. And to enable matters of this range and scale to find\\nunrestricted hospitality in our minds, everything superfluous must be turned out. Virtue will not\\nbring herself to enter the limited space we offer her; something of great size requires plenty of\\nroom. Let everything else be evicted, and your heart completely opened to her.\\n„But it‟s a nice thing, surely, to be familiar with a lot of subjects.‟ Well, in that case let us\\nretain just as much of them as we need. Would you consider a person open to criticism for\\nputting superfluous objects on the same level as really useful ones by arranging on display in his\\n\\n\\x0chouse a whole array of costly articles, but not for cluttering himself up with a lot of superfluous\\nfurniture in the way of learning? To want to know more than is sufficient is a form of\\nintemperance. Apart from which this kind of obsession with the liberal arts turns people into\\npedantic, irritating, tactless, self-satisfied bores, not learning what they need simply because they\\nspend their time learning things they will never need. The scholar Didymus wrote four thousand\\nworks: I should feel sorry for him if he had merely read so many useless works. In these works\\nhe discusses such questions as Homer‟s origin, who was Aeneas‟ real mother, whether\\nAnacreon‟s manner of life was more that of a lecher or that of a drunkard, whether Sappho slept\\nwith anyone who asked her, and other things that would be better unlearned if one actually knew\\nthem! Don‟t you go and tell me now that life is long enough for this sort of thing! When you\\ncome to writers in our own school, for that matter, I‟ll show you plenty of works which could do\\nwith some ruthless pruning. It costs a person an enormous amount of time (and other people‟s\\nears an enormous amount of boredom) before he earns such compliments as „What a learned\\nperson!‟ Let‟s be content with the much less fashionable label, „What a good man!‟…*\\nWhat about thinking how much time you lose through constantly being taken up with\\nofficial matters, private matters or ordinary everyday matters, through sleep, through ill health?\\nMeasure your life: it just does not have room for so much.\\nI have been speaking about liberal studies. Yet look at the amount of useless and\\nsuperfluous matter to be found in the philosophers. Even they have descended to the level of\\ndrawing distinctions between the uses of different syllables and discussing the proper meanings\\nof prepositions and conjunctions. They have come to envy the philologist and the mathematician,\\nand they have taken over all the inessential elements in those studies – with the result that they\\nknow more about devoting care and attention to their speech than about devoting such attention\\nto their lives. Listen and let me show you the sorry consequences to which subtlety carried too\\nfar can lead, and what an enemy it is to truth. Protagoras declares that it is possible to argue\\neither side of any question with equal force, even the question whether or not one can equally\\nargue either side of any question! Nausiphanes declares that of the things which appear to us to\\nexist, none exists any more than it does not exist. Parmenides declares that of all these\\nphenomena none exists except the whole. Zeno of Elea has dismissed all such difficulties by\\nintroducing another; he declares that nothing exists. The Pyrrhonean, Megarian, Eretrian and\\nAcademic schools pursue more or less similar lines; the last named have introduced a new\\nbranch of knowledge, non-knowledge.\\nWell, all these theories you should just toss on top of that heap of superfluous liberal\\nstudies. The people I first mentioned provide me with knowledge which is not going to be of any\\nuse to me, while the others snatch away from me any hopes of ever acquiring any knowledge at\\nall. Superfluous knowledge would be preferable to no knowledge. One side offers me no guiding\\nlight to direct my vision towards the truth, while the other just gouges my eyes out. If I believe\\nProtagoras there is nothing certain in the universe; if I believe Nausiphanes there is just the one\\ncertainty, that nothing is certain; if Parmenides, only one thing exists; if Zeno, not even one.\\nThen what are we? The things that surround us, the things on which we live, what are they? Our\\nwhole universe is no more than a semblance of reality, perhaps a deceptive semblance, perhaps\\none without substance altogether. I should find it difficult to say which of these people annoy me\\nmost, those who would have us know nothing or the ones who refuse even to leave us the small\\nsatisfaction of knowing that we know nothing.\\n\\nLETTER XC\\n\\n\\x0cWHO can doubt, my dear Lucilius, that life is the gift of the immortal gods, but that\\nliving well is the gift of philosophy? A corollary of this would be the certain conclusion that our\\ndebt to philosophy is greater than the debt we owe to the gods (by just so much as a good life is\\nmore of a blessing than, simply, life) had it not been for the fact that philosophy itself was\\nsomething bestowed by the gods. They have given no one the present of a knowledge of\\nphilosophy, but everyone the means of acquiring it. For if they had made philosophy a blessing\\ngiven to all and sundry, if we were born in a state of moral enlightenment, wisdom would have\\nbeen deprived of the best thing about her – that she isn‟t one of the things which fortune either\\ngives us or doesn‟t As things are, there is about wisdom a nobility and magnificence in the fact\\nthat she doesn‟t just fall to a person‟s lot, that each man owes her to his own efforts, that one\\ndoesn‟t go to anyone other than oneself to find her. What would you have worth looking up to in\\nphilosophy if she were handed out free?\\nPhilosophy has the single task of discovering the truth about the divine and human\\nworlds. The religious conscience, the sense of duty, justice and all the rest of the close-knit,\\ninterdependent „company of virtues‟, never leave her side. Philosophy has taught men to worship\\nwhat is divine, to love what is human, telling us that with the gods belongs authority, and among\\nhuman beings fellowship. That fellowship lasted for a long time intact, before men‟s greed broke\\nsociety up – and impoverished even those she had brought most riches; for people cease to\\npossess everything as soon as they want everything for themselves.\\nThe first men on this earth, however, and their immediate descendants, followed nature\\nunspoiled; they took a single person as their leader and their law, freely submitting to the\\ndecisions of an individual of superior merit. It is nature‟s way to subordinate the worse to the\\nbetter. With dumb animals, indeed, the ones who dominate the group are either the biggest or the\\nfiercest. The bull who leads the herd is not the weakling, but the one whose bulk and brawn has\\nbrought it victory over the other males. In a herd of elephants the tallest is the leader. Among\\nhuman beings the highest merit means the highest position. So they used to choose their ruler for\\nhis character. Hence peoples were supremely fortunate when among them a man could never be\\nmore powerful than others unless he was a better man than they were. For there is nothing\\ndangerous in a man‟s having as much power as he likes if he takes the view that he has power to\\ndo only what it is his duty to do.\\nIn that age, then, which people commonly refer to as the Golden Age, government, so\\nPosidonius maintains, was in the hands of the wise. They kept the peace, protected the weaker\\nfrom the stronger, urged and dissuaded, pointed out what was advantageous and what was not.\\nTheir ability to look ahead ensured that their peoples never went short of anything, whilst their\\nbravery averted dangers and their devotedness brought well-being and prosperity to their\\nsubjects. To govern was to serve, not to rule. No one used to try out the extent of his power over\\nthose to whom he owed that power in the first place. And no one had either reason or inclination\\nto perpetrate injustice, since people governing well were equally well obeyed, and a king could\\nissue no greater threat to disobedient subjects than that of his own abdication.\\nBut with the gradual infiltration of the vices and the resultant transformation of kingships\\ninto tyrannies, the need arose for laws, laws which were themselves, to begin with, drafted by the\\nwise. Solon, who established Athens as a democratic state, was one of the seven men of antiquity\\ncelebrated for their wisdom. If the same age had produced Lycurgus, an eighth name would have\\nbeen added to that revered number. The laws of Zaleucus and Charondas are still admired. And it\\nwas not in public life or in the chambers of lawyers that these two men learnt the constitutional\\nprinciples which they were to establish in Sicily (then in its heyday) and throughout the Greek\\n\\n\\x0careas of Italy, but in the secret retreat, now hallowed and famous, of Pythagoras.\\nThus far I agree with Posidonius. But that philosophy discovered the techniques\\nemployed in everyday life, that I refuse to admit. I will not claim for philosophy a fame that\\nbelongs to technology. „It was philosophy,‟ says Posidonius, „that taught men how to raise\\nbuildings at a time when they were widely dispersed and their shelter consisted of huts or\\nburrowed-out cliffs or hollowed tree trunks.‟ I for my part cannot believe that philosophy was\\nresponsible for the invention of these modern feats of engineering that rise up storey after storey,\\nor the cities of today crowding one against the next, any more than of our fish-tanks, those\\nenclosures designed to save men‟s gluttony from having to run the risk of storms and to ensure\\nextravagance safe harbours of her own, however wildly the high seas may be raging, in which to\\nfatten separately the different kinds of fish. Are you really going to tell me that philosophy\\ntaught the world to use keys and bolts on doors – which was surely nothing but a signal for\\ngreed? Was it philosophy that reared the towering buildings we know today, with all the danger\\nthey mean to the people living in them? It was not enough, presumably, for man to avail himself\\nof whatever cover came to hand, to have found a shelter of some kind or other in nature without\\ntrouble and without the use of skills. Believe me, that age before there ever existed architects or\\nbuilders was a happy age. The squaring off of timbers, the accurate cutting of beams with a saw\\nthat travels along a marked out line, all these things came in with extravagance.\\nThe first of men with wedges split their wood.*\\nYes, for they were not preparing a roof for a future banqueting-hall; and pines or firs\\nwere not continually being drawn through streets trembling at their passage on a long convoy of\\nvehicles to support panelled ceilings heavy with gold. Their huts were held up by a forked pole\\nstood at either end, and with close-packed branches and a sloping pile of leaves a run-off was\\narranged for even heavy rains. This was the kind of roof under which they lived and yet their\\nlives were free of care. For men in a state of freedom had thatch for their shelter, while slavery\\ndwells beneath marble and gold.\\nAnother matter on which I disagree with Posidonius is his belief that it was by wise men\\nthat tools were originally invented. On that sort of basis there is nothing to stop him saying that it\\nwas by philosophers that\\nDiscovered next were ways of snaring game,\\nOf catching birds with lime, of setting dogs\\nAll round deep woods.*\\nIt was human ingenuity, not wisdom, which discovered all that. I disagree with him again\\nwhere he maintains that it was wise men who discovered iron and copper mining (when the earth\\nhad been scorched by a forest fire and had melted to produce a flow from surface veins of ore).\\nThe person who discovers that sort of thing is the kind of person who makes it his business to be\\ninterested in just that sort of thing. Nor, for that matter, do I find it as nice a question as\\nPosidonius does, whether the hammer started to come into general use before the tongs or the\\nother way round. They were both invented by some individual of an alert, perceptive turn of\\nmind, but not one with the qualities of greatness or of inspiration. And the same applies to\\nanything else the quest of which involves a bent back and an earthward gaze.\\nThe wise man then followed a simple way of life – which is hardly surprising when you\\nconsider how even in this modern age he seeks to be as little encumbered as he possibly can.\\nHow, I ask you, can you consistently admire both Daedalus and Diogenes? Tell me which of\\nthese two you would say was a wise man, the one who hit on the saw, or the one who on seeing a\\nboy drinking water from the hollow of his hand, immediately took the cup out of his knapsack\\n\\n\\x0cand smashed it, telling himself off for his stupidity in having superfluous luggage about him all\\nthat time, and curled himself up in a jar56 and went to sleep. And today just tell me which of the\\nfollowing you consider the wiser man: the one who discovers a means of spraying saffron\\nperfumes to a tremendous height from hidden pipes, who fills or empties channels in one sudden\\nrush of water, who constructs a set of interchangeable ceilings for a dining room in such a way as\\nto produce a constant succession of different patterns, with a change of ceiling at each course?\\nOr the one who proves to others and to himself that nature makes no demand on us that is\\ndifficult or hard to meet and that we can live without the marble-worker and the engineer, that\\nwe can clothe ourselves without importing silks, that we can have the things we need for our\\nordinary purposes if we will only be content with what the earth has made available on its\\nsurface. If they only cared to listen to this man, the human race would realize that cooks are as\\nunnecessary to them as are soldiers.\\nThat race of men to whom taking care of the body was a straightforward enough matter\\nwere, if not philosophers, something very like it. The things that are essential are acquired with\\nlittle bother; it is the luxuries that call for toil and effort. Follow nature and you will feel no need\\nof craftsmen. It was nature‟s desire that we should not be kept occupied this. She equipped us for\\neverything she required us to contend with. „But the naked body can‟t stand cold.‟ So what? Are\\nthe skins of wild beasts and other creatures not capable of giving us more than adequate\\nprotection against the cold? Is it not a fact that many peoples make a covering for their bodies\\nout of bark, that feathers are sewn together to serve as clothing, that even today the majority of\\nthe Scythians wear the pelts of fox and mice, which are soft to the touch and impervious to\\nwind? Are you going to tell me too that any people you care to mention never used their hands to\\nweave a basketwork of wattles, smear it all over with common mud and then cover the whole\\nroof with long grass-stems and other material growing wild, and went through winter weather,\\nthe rains streaming down the slopes of the roof, without any worry? „But we need some pretty\\ndense shade to keep off the heat of the sun in summer.‟ So what? Have past ages not left us\\nplenty of hiding places that have been carved out by the ravages of time, or whatever other cause\\none cares to suppose, and have developed into caves? And again, is it not a fact that Syrtian\\ntribes take shelter in pits dug in the ground, as do other people who, because of extreme sun\\ntemperatures, find nothing less than the baked earth itself sufficiently substantial as a protective\\ncovering against the heat? When nature granted all the other animals a simple passage through\\nlife, she was not so unfair to man as to make it impossible for him, for him alone, to live without\\nall these skills. Nature demanded nothing hard from us, and nothing needs painful contriving to\\nenable life to be kept going. We were born into a world in which things were ready to our hands;\\nit is we who have made everything difficult to come by through our own disdain for what is\\neasily come by. Shelter and apparel and the means of warming body and food, all the things\\nwhich nowadays entail tremendous trouble, were there for the taking, free to all, obtainable at\\ntrifling effort. With everything the limit corresponded to the need. It is we, and no one else, who\\nhave made those same things costly, spectacular and obtainable only by means of a large number\\nof full-scale techniques.\\nNature suffices for all she asks of us. Luxury has turned her back on nature, daily urging\\nherself on and growing through all the centuries, pressing men‟s intelligence into the\\ndevelopment of the vices. First she began to hanker after things that were inessential, and then\\nafter things that were injurious, and finally she handed the mind over to the body and\\ncommanded it to be the out and out slave of the body‟s whim and pleasure. All those trades that\\ngive rise to noise or hectic activity in the city are in business for the body, which was once in the\\n\\n\\x0cposition of the slave, having everything issued to it, and is now the master, having everything\\nprocured for it. This is the starting point for textile and engineering workshops, for the perfumes\\nused by chefs, the sensual movements of our dancing teachers, even sensual and unmanly songs.\\nAnd why? Because the bounds of nature, which set a limit to man‟s wants by relieving them only\\nwhere there is necessity for such relief, have been lost sight of; to want simply what is enough\\nnowadays suggests to people primitiveness and squalor.\\nIt is incredible, Lucilius, how easily even great men can be carried away from the truth by\\nthe sheer pleasure of holding forth on a subject. Look at Posidonius, in my opinion one of those\\nwho have contributed most to philosophy, when he wants to give a description of how, in the\\nfirst place, some threads are twisted and others drawn out from the soft, loose hank of wool, then\\nhow the warp has its threads stretched perpendicularly by means of hanging weights, and how\\nthe weft (worked in to soften the hard texture of the warp threads which compress it on either\\nside) is made compact and close by means of the batten; he declares that philosophers invented\\nthe art of the weaver too, forgetting that philosophers had disappeared by the time this\\ncomparatively advanced type of weaving in which\\nThe warp is bound to the beam, and then its threads\\nAre parted by the reed, the woof worked in\\nBetween with pointed shuttles and pressed home\\nBy the broad comb‟s fretted teeth*\\nhad been evolved. He might have thought differently if he had only had the opportunity\\nof seeing the looms of the present day, the end product of which is clothing which is not going to\\nconceal a thing, clothing which is no help to modesty let alone the body! He then goes on to\\nfarmers, and gives an equally eloquent description of how the soil is broken up by the plough for\\nthe first time and then gone over again in order that the earth, this loosened, may allow the roots\\nmore room to develop, and continues with the sowing of the seed and the lifting of the weeds to\\nprevent any stray wild plants springing up and ruining the crop. All this, too, he represents as\\nbeing the work of philosophers, as if agriculturists were not, now as ever, discovering plenty of\\nnew methods of increasing the soil‟s productivity.\\nNot content with these occupations, he proceeds to demean the philosopher to the bakery;\\nhe tells us how by imitating nature he began producing bread. „The grain,‟ he says, „is taken into\\nthe mouth and crushed by the coming together of the hard surfaces of the teeth; anything that\\nescapes is carried back to the teeth again by the tongue, and the grain is finally mixed with saliva\\nto enable it to pass down the lubricated throat with greater facility; on reaching the stomach,\\nwhere it is cooked in an even heat, it is finally absorbed into the system. Taking this process as a\\nmodel, someone or other placed one rough stone on top of another in imitation of the teeth, one\\nset of which remains immobile and awaits the action of the other; the grains are then crushed by\\nthe friction of the one against the other, and are constantly re-subjected to it until they are\\nreduced by this repeated grinding to a fine powder. He then sprinkled the resulting meal with\\nwater, and by going on manipulating it he made it plastic, and shaped it into the form of a loaf.\\nThis he first baked in a glowing hot earthenware vessel in hot ashes; later came the gradual\\ndiscovery of ovens and other devices the heat of which is controllable at will.‟ Posidonius was\\nnot far off maintaining that the shoemaker‟s trade as well was invented by philosophers!\\nNow all these things were indeed discovered by the exercise of reason, but not by reason\\nin its perfect form. They were invented by ordinary men, not by philosophers – just as, let me\\nadd, were the vessels we cross rivers and seas in, with sails designed to catch the drive of the\\nwinds and rudders at the stern to alter the vessel‟s course in this or that direction (the idea being\\n\\n\\x0ctaken from the fish, who steers with his tail, one slight movement of it to either side being\\nenough to alter the direction of his darting course). „All these things,‟ says Posidonius, „were\\ninvented by our philosopher. They were, however, rather too unimportant for him to handle\\npersonally, and so he passed them over to the minions among his assistants.‟ No, the fact is that\\nthis sort of thing was not thought up by anyone other than the people who make them their\\nconcern today. We know very well that some have only appeared within living memory, the use,\\nfor example, of windows letting in the full daylight through transparent panes, or bathrooms\\nheated from beneath with pipes set in the walls in order to diffuse the heat and this maintain an\\neven temperature at the highest as well as the lowest room levels. Need I mention the marble\\nwith which our temples and even houses are resplendent? Or the rounded and polished blocks on\\nwhich we rest whole colonnades and buildings capable of holding large crowds of people? Or the\\nshorthand symbols by means of which even a rapidly delivered speech is taken down and the\\nhand is able to keep up with the quickness of the tongue? These are inventions of the lowest\\nslaves. Philosophy is far above all this; she does not train men‟s hands: she is the instructress of\\nmen‟s minds.\\nYou want to know, do you, what philosophy has unearthed, what philosophy has\\nachieved? It is not the gracefulness of dance movements, nor the variety of sounds produced by\\nhorn or flute as they take in breath and transform it, in its passage through or out of the\\ninstrument, into notes. She does not set about constructing arms or walls or anything of use in\\nwar. On the contrary, her voice is for peace, calling all mankind to live in harmony. And she is\\nnot, I insist, the manufacturer of equipment for everyday essential purposes. Why must you make\\nher responsible for such insignificant things? In her you see the mistress of the art of life itself.\\nShe has, indeed, authority over other arts, inasmuch as all activities that provide life with its\\napparatus must also be the servants of that of which life itself is the servant. Philosophy,\\nhowever, takes as her aim the state of happiness. That is the direction in which she opens routes\\nand guides us. She shows us what are real and what are only apparent evils. She strips men‟s\\nminds of empty thinking, bestows a greatness that is solid and administers a check to greatness\\nwhere it is puffed up and all an empty show; she sees that we are left in no doubt about the\\ndifference between what is great and what is bloated. And she imparts a knowledge of the whole\\nof nature, as well as of herself. She explains what the gods are, and what they are like….*\\n„Anacharsis,‟ says Posidonius, „discovered the potter‟s wheel, the rotary motion of which\\nshapes earthenware.‟ Then, mention of the potter‟s wheel being found in Homer, he would have\\nus think that it is the passage in Homer, rather than his story, that is spurious. I maintain that\\nAnacharsis was not responsible for this invention, and that even if he was, he discovered it as a\\nphilosopher, yes, but not in his capacity as a philosopher, in the same way as philosophers do\\nplenty of things as men without doing them in their capacity as philosophers. Suppose, for\\nexample, a philosopher happens to be a very fast runner; in a race he will come first by virtue of\\nhis ability as a runner, not by virtue of his being a philosopher. I should like to show Posidonius\\nsome glass-blower moulding glass by means of his breath into a whole variety of shapes that\\ncould hardly be fashioned by the most careful hand – discoveries that have occurred in the period\\nsince the disappearance of the wise man. „Democritus,‟ he says, „is reported to be the discoverer\\nof the arch, the idea of which is to bind a curving line of stones, set at slightly differing angles\\nfrom each other, with a keystone.‟ This I should say was quite untrue. For there must have been\\nboth bridges and gateways before Democritus‟ time, and the upper parts of these generally have\\na curve to them. And it seems to have escaped your memory, Posidonius, that this same\\nDemocritus discovered a means of softening ivory, and a means of turning a pebble into an\\n\\n\\x0c„emerald‟ by boiling it, a method employed even today for colouring certain stones that man has\\ndiscovered and found amenable to the process. These techniques may indeed have been\\ndiscovered by a philosopher, but not in his capacity as a philosopher. For there are plenty of\\nthings which he does which one sees being done just as well if not with greater skill and\\ndexterity by persons totally lacking in wisdom.\\nWhat has the philosopher investigated? What has the philosopher brought to light? In the\\nfirst place, truth and nature (having, unlike the rest of the animal world, followed nature with\\nmore than just a pair of eyes, things slow to grasp divinity); and secondly, a rule of life, in which\\nhe has brought life into line with things universal. And he has taught us not just to recognize but\\nto obey the gods, and to accept all that happens exactly as if it were an order from above. He has\\ntold us not to listen to false opinions, and has weighed and valued everything against standards\\nwhich are true. He has condemned pleasures an inseparable element of which is subsequent\\nregret, has commended the good things which will always satisfy, and for all to see has made the\\nman who has no need of luck the luckiest man of all, and the man who is master of himself the\\nmaster of all.\\nThe philosophy I speak of is not the one* which takes the citizen out of public life and\\nthe gods out of the world we live in, and hands morality over to pleasure, but the philosophy\\nwhich thinks nothing good unless it is honourable, which is incapable of being enticed astray by\\nthe rewards of men or fortune, and the very pricelessness of which lies in the fact that it cannot\\nbe bought at any price. And I do not believe that this philosophy was in existence in that\\nprimitive era in which technical skills were still unknown and useful knowledge was acquired\\nthrough actual practical experience, or that it dates from an age that was happy, an age in which\\nthe bounties of nature were freely available for the use of all without discrimination, before\\navarice and luxury split human beings up and got them to abandon partnership for plunder. The\\nmen of that era were not philosophers, even if they acted as philosophers are supposed to act.†\\nNo other state of man could cause anyone greater admiration; if God were to allow a man to\\nfashion the things of this earth and allot its peoples their social customs, that man would not be\\nsatisfied with any other system than the one which tradition says existed in those people‟s time,\\namong whom\\nNo farmers tilled ploughed fields; merely to mark\\nThe line of boundaries dividing land\\nBetween its owners was a sin; men shared\\nTheir findings, and the earth herself then gave\\nAll things more freely unsolicited.*\\nWhat race of men could be luckier? Share and share alike they enjoyed nature. She saw\\nto each and every man‟s requirements for survival like a parent. What it all amounted to was\\nundisturbed possession of resources owned by the community. I can surely call that race of men\\none of unparalleled riches, it being impossible to find a single pauper in it.\\nInto this ideal state of things burst avarice, avarice which in seeking to put aside some\\narticle or other and appropriate it to its own use, only succeeded in making everything somebody\\nelse‟s property and reducing its possessions to a fraction of its previously unlimited wealth.\\nAvarice brought in poverty, by coveting a lot of possessions losing all that it had. This is why\\nalthough it may endeavour to make good its losses, may acquire estate after estate by buying out\\nor forcing out its neighbours, enlarge country properties to the dimensions of whole provinces,\\nspeak of „owning some property‟ when it can go on a long tour overseas without once stepping\\noff its own land, there is no extension of our boundaries that can bring us back to our starting\\n\\n\\x0cpoint. When we have done everything within our power, we shall possess a great deal: but we\\nonce possessed the world.\\nThe earth herself, untilled, was more productive, her yields being more than ample for the\\nneeds of peoples who did not raid each other. With any of nature‟s products, men found as much\\npleasure in showing others what they had discovered as they did in discovering it. No one could\\noutdo or be outdone by any other. All was equally divided among people living in complete\\nharmony. The stronger had not yet started laying hands on the weaker; the avaricious person had\\nnot yet started hiding things away, to be hoarded for his own private use, so shutting the next\\nman off from actual necessities of life; each cared as much about the other as about himself.\\nWeapons were unused; hands still unstained with human blood had directed their hostility\\nexclusively against wild beasts.\\nProtected from the sun in some thick wood, living in some very ordinary shelter under a\\ncovering of leaves preserving them from the rigours of winter or the rain, those people passed\\ntranquil nights with never a sigh. We in our crimson luxury toss and turn with worry, stabbed by\\nneedling cares. What soft sleep the hard earth gave those people! They had no carved or panelled\\nceilings hanging over them. They lay out in the open, with the stars slipping past above them and\\nthe firmament silently conveying onward that mighty work of creation as it was carried headlong\\nbelow the horizon in the magnificent pageant of the night sky. And they had clear views by day\\nas well as by night of this loveliest of mansions, enjoying the pleasure of watching constellations\\nfalling away from the zenith and others rising again from out of sight beneath the horizon. Surely\\nit was a joy to roam the earth with marvels scattered so widely around one. You now, by\\ncontrast, go pale at every noise your houses make, and if there is a creaking sound you run away\\nalong your frescoed passages in alarm. Those people had no mansions on the scale of towns.\\nFresh air and the untrammelled breezes of the open spaces, the unoppressive shade of a tree or\\nrock, springs of crystal clarity, streams which chose their own course, streams unsullied by the\\nwork of man, by pipes or any other interference with their natural channels, meadows whose\\nbeauty owed nothing to man‟s art, that was the environment around their dwelling places in the\\ncountryside, dwelling places given a simple countryman‟s finish. This was a home in conformity\\nwith nature, a home in which one enjoyed living, and which occasioned neither fear of it nor\\nfears for it, whereas nowadays our own homes count for a large part of our feeling of insecurity.\\nBut however wonderful and guileless the life they led, they were not wise men; this is a\\ntitle that has come to be reserved for the highest of all achievements. All the same, I should be\\nthe last to deny that they were men of exalted spirit, only one step removed, so to speak, from the\\ngods. There can be no doubt that before this earth was worn out it produced a better type of\\noffspring. But though they all possessed a character more robust than that of today, and one with\\na greater aptitude for hard work, it is equally true that their personalities fell short of genuine\\nperfection. For nature does not give a man virtue: the process of becoming a good man is an art.\\nCertainly they did not go in search of gold or silver or the various crystalline stones to be found\\nin the nethermost dregs of the earth. They were still merciful even to dumb animals. Man was far\\nand away from killing man, not out of fear or provocation, but simply for entertainment. They\\nhad yet to wear embroidered clothing, and had yet to have gold woven into robes, or even mine\\nit. But the fact remains that their innocence was due to ignorance and nothing else. And there is a\\nworld of difference between, on the one hand, choosing not to do what is wrong and, on the\\nother, not knowing how to do it in the first place. They lacked the cardinal virtues of justice,\\nmoral insight, selfcontrol and courage. There were corresponding qualities, in each case not\\nunlike these, that had a place in their primitive lives; but virtue only comes to a character which\\n\\n\\x0chas been thoroughly schooled and trained and brought to a pitch of perfection by unremitting\\npractice. We are born for it, but not with it. And even in the best of people, until you cultivate it\\nthere is only the material for virtue, not virtue itself.\\n\\nLETTER XCI\\nMY friend Liberalis is in some distress at the present moment following the news of the\\ncomplete destruction of Lyons by fire. It is a disaster by which anyone might be shaken, let alone\\na person quite devoted to his home town. This event has left him groping for that staunchness of\\nspirit which, naturally enough, he cultivated when it was a case of facing what to him were\\nconceivable fears. One is not surprised, though, that there were never any advance fears of such\\nan unexpected, virtually unheard of catastrophe, considering that there was no precedent for it.\\nPlenty of cities have suffered damage by fire, but none has ever been blotted out by one. Even\\nwhen its buildings have been set aflame by enemy hands, in many places the flames the out, and\\neven if they are continually rekindled they are seldom so all-consuming as to leave nothing for\\ntools to demolish. Earthquakes, too, have hardly ever been so ruinous and violent as to raze\\nwhole towns. There has never in fact been a fire so destructive as to leave nothing for a future\\nfire to consume. But here a single night has laid low a host of architectural splendours any one of\\nwhich might have been the glory of a separate city. In the depth of peace there has come such a\\nblow as could not have been dreaded in war itself. Who would believe it? At a time when\\nmilitary conflict is in abeyance everywhere, when an international peace covers all parts of the\\nglobe, Lyons, the showpiece of Gaul, is lost to view. Fortune invariably allows those whom she\\nstrikes down in the sight of all a chance to fear what they were going to suffer. The fall of\\nanything great generally takes time. But here a single night is all there was between a mighty city\\nand no city at all. It was destroyed in fact in less time than I have taken telling you of its\\ndestruction.\\nSturdy and resolute though he is when it comes to facing his own troubles, our Liberalis\\nhas been deeply shocked by the whole thing. And he has some reason to be shaken. What is quite\\nunlooked for is more crushing in its effect, and unexpectedness adds to the weight of a disaster.\\nThe fact that it was unforeseen has never failed to intensify a person‟s grief. This is a reason for\\nensuring that nothing ever takes us by surprise. We should project our thoughts ahead of us at\\nevery turn and have in mind every possible eventuality instead of only the usual course of events.\\nFor what is there that fortune does not when she pleases fell at the height of its powers? What is\\nthere that is not the more assailed and buffeted by her the more lustrous its attraction? What is\\nthere that is troublesome or difficult for her? Her assaults do not always come along a single\\npath, or even a well-recognized path. At one time she will call in the aid of our own hands in\\nattacking us, at another she will be content with her own powers in devising for us dangers for\\nwhich no one is responsible. No moment is exempt: in the midst of pleasures there are found the\\nsprings of suffering. In the middle of peace war rears its head, and the bulwarks of one‟s security\\nare transformed into sources of alarm, friend turning foe and ally turning enemy. The summer‟s\\ncalm is upset by sudden storms more severe than those of winter. In the absence of any enemy\\nwe suffer all that an enemy might wreak on us. Overmuch prosperity if all else fails will hit on\\nthe instruments of its own destruction. Sickness assails those leading the most sensible lives,\\ntuberculosis those with the strongest constitutions, retribution the utterly guiltless, violence the\\nmost secluded. Misfortune has a way of choosing some unprecedented means or other of\\nimpressing its power on those who might be said to have forgotten it. A single day strews in\\nruins all that was raised by a train of construction extending over a long span of time and\\n\\n\\x0cinvolving a great number of separate works and a great deal of favour on the part of heaven. To\\nsay a „day‟, indeed, is to put too much of a brake on the calamities that hasten down upon us: an\\nhour, an instant of time, suffices for the overthrow of empires. It would be some relief to our\\ncondition and our frailty if all things were as slow in their perishing as they were in their coming\\ninto being: but as it is, the growth of things is a tardy process and their undoing is a rapid matter.\\nNothing is durable, whether for an individual or for a society; the destinies of men and\\ncities alike sweep onwards. Terror strikes amid the most tranquil surroundings, and without any\\ndisturbance in the background to give rise to them calamities spring from the least expected\\nquarter. States which stood firm through civil war as well as wars external collapse without a\\nhand being raised against them. How few nations have made of their prosperity a lasting thing!\\nThis is why we need to envisage every possibility and to strengthen the spirit to deal with the\\nthings which may conceivably come about. Rehearse them in your mind: exile, torture, war,\\nshipwreck. Misfortune may snatch you away from your country, or your country away from you,\\nmay banish you into some wilderness – these very surroundings in which the masses suffocate\\nmay become a wilderness. All the terms of our human lot should be before our eyes; we should\\nbe anticipating not merely all that commonly happens but all that is conceivably capable of\\nhappening, if we do not want to be overwhelmed and struck numb by rare events as if they were\\nunprecedented ones; fortune needs envisaging in a thoroughly comprehensive way. Think how\\noften towns in Asia or in Greece have fallen at a single earth tremor, how many villages in Syria\\nor Macedonia have been engulfed, how often this form of disaster has wrought devastation in\\nCyprus, how often Paphos has tumbled about itself! Time and again we hear the news of the\\nannihilation of a whole city, and how small a fraction of mankind are we who hear such news\\nthis often! So let us face up to the blows of circumstance and be aware that whatever happens is\\nnever as serious as rumour makes it out to be.\\nSo a city has burned, a wealthy city and the glory of the provinces of which it was a\\nfeature though it stood in a class of its own, perched as it was on a single hill and that not a hill\\nof very great dimensions. But time will sweep away the very traces of every one of those cities\\nof whose splendour and magnificence you nowadays hear. Look at the way the very foundations\\nof once famous cities of Greece have been eroded by now to the point where nothing is left to\\nshow that they ever even existed. And it is not only the works of human hands that waste away,\\nnor only structures raised by human skill and industry that the passing days demolish. Mountain\\nmassifs crumble away, whole regions have subsided, the waves have covered landmarks once far\\nout of sight of the sea. The immense force of volcanic fires that once made the mountain-tops\\nglow has eaten them away and reduced to lowly stature what once were soaring peaks, reassuring\\nbeacons to the mariner. The works of nature herself suffer. So it is only right that we should bear\\nthe overthrow of cities with resignation. They stand just to fall. Such is the sum total of the end\\nthat awaits them, whether it be the blast of a subterranean explosion throwing off the restraining\\nweight above it, or the violence of floodwaters increasing to a prodigious degree underground\\nuntil it breaks down everything in its way, or a volcanic outburst fracturing the earth‟s crust, or\\nage (to which nothing is immune) overcoming them little by little, or plague carrying off its\\npopulation and causing the deserted area to decay. It would be tedious to recount all the different\\nways by which fate may overtake them. One thing I know: all the works of mortal man lie under\\nsentence of mortality; we live among things that are destined to perish.\\nSuch, then, are the comforting reflections which I would offer our Liberalis, who burns\\nwith a kind of passion beyond belief for his birthplace – which it may be has only been\\nconsumed so as to be called to higher things. A setback has often cleared the way for greater\\n\\n\\x0cprosperity. Many things have fallen only to rise to more exalted heights. That opponent of\\naffluence in the capital, Timagenes, used to declare that the one reason fires distressed him was\\nthe knowledge that what would rise up afterwards would be of a better standard than what had\\nburned. In the city of Lyons, too, one may presume that everyone will endeavour to make the\\nwork of restoration a greater, more noble achievement than what they have lost. May that work\\nbe of lasting duration, and may the new foundation be attended by happier auspices with a view\\nto its lasting for a longer and indeed for all time! This is the hundredth year since the town came\\ninto being, and even for a human being such an age is by no means the uttermost limit. Founded\\nby Plancus in an area of concentrated population, it owes its growth to its favourable situation:\\nyet how many grievous blows it has had to suffer in the time it takes for a man to grow old.\\nSo the spirit must be trained to a realization and an acceptance of its lot. It must come to\\nsee that there is nothing fortune will shrink from, that she wields the same authority over\\nemperor and empire alike and the same power over cities as over men. There‟s no ground for\\nresentment in all this. We‟ve entered into a world in which these are the terms life is lived on – if\\nyou‟re satisfied with that, submit to them, if you‟re not, get out, whatever way you please.\\nResent a thing by all means if it represents an injustice decreed against yourself personally; but if\\nthis same constraint is binding on the lowest and the highest alike, then make your peace again\\nwith destiny, the destiny that unravels all ties. There‟s no justification for using our graves and\\nall the variety of monuments we see bordering the highways as a measure of our stature. In the\\nashes all men are levelled. We‟re born unequal, we the equal. And my words apply as much to\\ncities as to those who live in them. Ardea was taken, and so was Rome. The great lawgiver draws\\nno distinctions between us according to our birth or the celebrity of our names, save only while\\nwe exist. On the reaching of mortality‟s end he declares, „Away with snobbery; all that the earth\\ncarries shall forthwith be subject to one law without discrimination.‟ When it comes to all we‟re\\nrequired to go through, we‟re equals. No one is more vulnerable than the next man, and no one\\ncan be more sure of his surviving to the morrow.\\nKing Alexander of Macedon once took up the study of geometry – poor fellow, inasmuch\\nas he would this find out how minute the earth really was, the earth of which he had possessed\\nhimself of a tiny part; yes, „poor fellow‟ I call him, for the reason that he was bound to discover\\nthat his title was a false one; for who can be „Great‟ in an area of minute dimensions? Anyway,\\nthe points he was being instructed in were of some subtlety and such that the learning of them\\ndemanded the closest concentration, not the sort of thing that would be grasped by a crazed\\nindividual projecting his thoughts across the seas. „Teach me,‟ he said, „the easy things,‟ to\\nwhich his instructor answered, „These things are the same for everyone, equally difficult for all.‟\\nWell, imagine that nature is saying to you, “Those things you grumble about are the same for\\neveryone. I can give no one anything easier. But anyone who likes may make them easier for\\nhimself.‟ How? By viewing them with equanimity.\\nYou must needs experience pain and hunger and thirst, and grow old (assuming that you\\nare vouchsafed a relatively long stay among men) and be ill, and suffer loss, and finally perish.\\nBut you needn‟t believe the chatter of the people around you: there‟s nothing in all this that‟s\\nevil, insupportable or even hard. Those people are afraid of these things by a kind of general\\nconsent. Are you going to feel alarm at death, then, in the same way as you might at some\\ncommon report? What could be more foolish than a man‟s being afraid of people‟s words? My\\nfriend Demetrius has a nice way of putting things when he says, as he commonly does, that to\\nhim the utterances of the unenlightened are as noises emanating from the belly. „What difference\\ndoes it make to me,‟ he asks, „whether their rumblings come from their upper or their nether\\n\\n\\x0cregions?‟\\nWhat utter foolishness it is to be afraid that those who have a bad name can rob you of a\\ngood one. Just as the dread aroused in you by some common report has proved groundless, so\\ntoo is the dread of things of which you would never be afraid if common report did not tell you\\nto be. What harm could ever come to a good man from being besmirched by unwarranted\\ngossip? We shouldn‟t even let it prejudice us against death, which itself has an evil reputation.\\nYet none of the people who malign it has put it to the test. Until one does it‟s rather rash to\\ncondemn a thing one knows nothing about. And yet one thing you do know and that is this, how\\nmany people it‟s a blessing to, how many people it frees from torture, want, maladies, suffering,\\nweariness. And no one has power over us when death is within our own power.\\n\\nLETTER CIV\\nI HAVE got away to my place at Nomentum – getting away from what? Guess. The city?\\nNo, a fever. And just as it was infiltrating my defences, too. It had already taken a hold on me,\\nmy doctor being decided in his opinion that a disturbed, irregular pulse, its natural rhythm upset,\\nwas the start of it. Whereupon I immediately ordered my carriage out, and although my Paulina\\ntried to hold me back, insisted on driving away. I kept saying the same thing as my mentor Gallio\\nwhen he started sickening for a fever in Achaea. He immediately boarded a ship, assuring\\neveryone that the disorder was to be put down to the place where he was living and not to his\\nconstitution.\\nI told Paulina this. She is forever urging me to take care of my health; and indeed as I\\ncome to realize the way her very being depends on mine, I am beginning, in my concern for her,\\nto feel some concern for myself. So although old age has made me better at putting up with a lot\\nof things, here I am coming to lose this advantage of being old. The notion occurs to me that\\ninside this old frame there exists a young man as well and one is always less severe on a young\\nman. The consequence is that since I haven‟t managed to get her to put a little more bravery into\\nher love for me, she has managed to induce me to show a little more love and care for myself.\\nFor concessions have to be made to legitimate emotions. There are times when, however\\npressing one‟s reasons to the contrary, one‟s dying breath requires to be summoned back and\\nheld back even as it is passing one‟s lips, even if this amounts to torture, simply out of\\nconsideration for one‟s dear ones. The good man should go on living as long as he ought to, not\\njust as long as he likes. The man who does not value his wife or a friend highly enough to stay on\\na little longer in life, who persists in dying in spite of them, is a thoroughly self-indulgent\\ncharacter. This is a duty which the soul should also impose on itself when it is merely the\\nconvenience of near and dear ones that demands it. And not only if and when it feels the wish to\\ndie, but also if and when it has begun to carry out the wish, it should pause a while to fit in with\\ntheir interests.\\nTo return to life for another‟s sake is a sign of a noble spirit; it is something that great\\nmen have done on a number of occasions. Yet to give your old age greater care and attentiveness\\nin the realization that this pleases any of the persons closest to you, or is in their interests, or\\nwould be likely to gratify them (and this in spite of the fact that the greatest reward of that period\\nis the opportunity it gives you to adopt a relatively carefree attitude towards looking after\\nyourself and a more adventurous manner of living), is also, to my mind, a mark of the highest\\npossible kindness. Besides it brings you more than a little pleasure and recompense: for can\\nanything be sweeter than to find that you are so dear to your wife that this makes you dearer to\\nyourself? So it comes about that my Paulina succeeds in making me responsible for anxiety of\\n\\n\\x0cmy own as well as hers on my behalf.\\nI expect you‟re keen to hear what effect it had on my health, this decision of mine to\\nleave? Well, no sooner had I left behind the oppressive atmosphere of the city and that reek of\\nsmoking cookers which pour out, along with a cloud of ashes, all the poisonous fumes they‟ve\\naccumulated in their interiors whenever they‟re started up, than I noticed the change in my\\ncondition at once. You can imagine how much stronger I felt after reaching my vineyards! I\\nfairly waded into my food – talk about animals just turned out on to spring grass! So by now I\\nam quite my old self again. That feeling of listlessness, being bodily ill at ease and mentally\\ninefficient, didn‟t last. I‟m beginning to get down to some whole-hearted work.\\nThis is not something, however, to which mere surroundings are conducive, unless the\\nmind is at its own disposal, able at will to provide its own seclusion even in crowded moments.\\nOn the contrary, the man who spends his time choosing one resort after another in a hunt for\\npeace and quiet, will in every place he visits find something to prevent him from relaxing. The\\nstory is told that someone complained to Socrates that travelling abroad had never done him any\\ngood and received the reply: „What else can you expect, seeing that you always take yourself\\nalong with you when you go abroad?‟ What a blessing it would be for some people if they could\\nonly lose themselves ! As things are these persons are a worry and a burden, a source of\\ndemoralization and anxiety, to their own selves. What good does it do you to go overseas, to\\nmove from city to city? If you really want to escape the things that harass you, what you‟re\\nneeding is not to be in a different place but to be a different person. Suppose you‟ve arrived in\\nAthens, or suppose it‟s Rhodes – choose any country you like – what difference does the\\ncharacter of the place make? You‟ll only be importing your own with you. You‟ll still look on\\nwealth as a thing to be valued: your poverty will be causing you torment, while (this being the\\nmost pathetic thing about it all) your poverty will be imaginary. However much you possess\\nthere‟s someone else who has more, and you‟ll be fancying yourself to be short of things you\\nneed to the exact extent to which you lag behind him. Another thing that you‟ll regard as\\nsomething to be valued is success in public life; in which case you‟re going to feel resentment\\nwhen so-and-so is elected consul (or when so-and-so is re-elected for that matter), and be jealous\\nwhenever you see a person‟s name appearing too often in the honours-lists. Your ambition will\\nbe running at so feverish a pitch that if anyone‟s ahead of you in the race you‟ll see yourself as\\ncoming last.\\nDeath you‟ll think of as the worst of all bad things, though in fact there‟s nothing bad\\nabout it at all except the thing which comes before it – the fear of it. You‟ll be scared stiff by\\nillusory as well as genuine dangers, haunted by imaginary alarms. What good will it do you to\\nHave found a route past all those Argive forts\\nAnd won escape right through the enemy‟s lines?*\\nPeace itself will supply you with new fears. If your mind has once experienced the shocks\\nof fright you‟ll no longer have any confidence even in things which are perfectly safe; once it has\\nacquired the habit of unthinking panic, it is incapable even of attending to its own\\nself-preservation. For it runs away from dangers instead of taking steps to avert them, and we‟re\\nfar more exposed to them once our backs are turned.\\nTo lose someone you love is something you‟ll regard as the hardest of all blows to bear,\\nwhile all the time this will be as silly as crying because the leaves fall from the beautiful trees\\nthat add to the charm of your home. Preserve a sense of proportion in your attitude to everything\\nthat pleases you, and make the most of them while they are at their best. At one moment chance\\nwill carry off one of them, at another moment another; but the falling of the leaves is not difficult\\n\\n\\x0cto bear, since they grow again, and it is no more hard to bear the loss of those whom you love\\nand regard as brightening your existence; for even if they do not grow again they are replaced\\n„But their successors will never be quite the same‟ No, and neither will you. Every day, every\\nhour sees a change in you, although the ravages of time are easier to see in others; in your own\\ncase they are far less obvious, because to you they do not show. While other people are snatched\\naway from us, we are being filched away surreptitiously from ourselves.\\nAre you never going to give any of these considerations any thought and never going to\\napply any healing treatment to your wounds, instead of sowing the seeds of worry for yourself by\\nhoping for this or that, or despairing of obtaining this or that other thing? If you‟re sensible\\nyou‟ll run the two together, and never hope without an element of despair, never despair without\\nan element of hope.\\nWhat good has travel of itself ever been able to do anyone? It has never acted as a check\\non pleasure or a restraining influence on desires; it has never controlled the temper of an angry\\nman or quelled the reckless impulses of a lover; never in fact has it rid the personality of a fault.\\nIt has not granted us the gift of judgement, it has not put an end to mistaken attitudes. All it has\\never done is distract us for a little while, through the novelty of our surroundings, like children\\nfascinated by something they haven‟t come across before. The instability, moreover, of a mind\\nwhich is seriously unwell, is aggravated by it, the motion itself increasing the fitfulness and\\nrestlessness. This explains why people, after setting out for a place with the greatest of\\nenthusiasm, are often more enthusiastic about getting away from it; like migrant birds, they fly\\non, away even quicker than they came.\\nTravel will give you a knowledge of other countries, it will show you mountains whose\\noutlines are quite new to you, stretches of unfamiliar plains, valleys watered by perennial\\nstreams; it will allow you to observe the unique features of this or that river, the way in which,\\nfor example, the Nile rises in summer flood, or the Tigris vanishes from sight and at the\\ncompletion of its journey through hidden subterranean regions is restored to view with its\\nvolume undiminished, or the way the Meander, theme of every poet‟s early training exercises,\\nwinds about, loop after loop, and again and again is carried close to its own bed and then once\\nmore diverted into a different course before it can flow into its own stream. But travel won‟t\\nmake a better or saner man of you. For this we must spend time in study and in the writings of\\nwise men, to learn the truths that have emerged from their researches, and carry on the search\\nourselves for the answers that have not yet been discovered. This is the way to liberate the spirit\\nthat still needs to be rescued from its miserable state of slavery.\\nSo long, in fact, as you remain in ignorance of what to aim at and what to avoid, what is\\nessential and what is superfluous, what is upright or honourable conduct and what is not, it will\\nnot be travelling but drifting. All this hurrying from place to place won‟t bring you any relief, for\\nyou‟re travelling in the company of your own emotions, followed by your troubles all the way. If\\nonly they were really following you! They‟d be farther away from you: as it is they‟re not at your\\nback, but on it! That‟s why they weigh you down with just the same uncomfortable chafing\\nwherever you are. It‟s medicine, not a particular part of the world, that a person needs if he‟s ill.\\nSuppose someone has broken his leg or dislocated a joint; he doesn‟t get into a carriage or board\\na ship: he calls in a doctor to have the fracture set or the dislocation reduced. Well then, when a\\nperson‟s spirit is wrenched or broken at so many points, do you imagine that it can be put right\\nby a change of scenery, that that sort of trouble isn‟t so serious that it can‟t be cured by an\\nouting?\\nTravelling doesn‟t make a man a doctor or a public speaker: there isn‟t a single art which\\n\\n\\x0cis acquired merely by being in one place rather wan another. Can wisdom, then, the greatest art\\nof all, be picked up in the course of taking a trip? Take my word for it, the trip doesn‟t exist that\\ncan set you beyond the reach of cravings, fits of temper, or fears. If it did, the human race would\\nbe off there in a body. So long as you carry the sources of your troubles about with you, those\\ntroubles will continue to harass and plague you wherever you wander on land or on sea. Does it\\nsurprise you that running away doesn‟t do you any good? The things you‟re running away from\\nare with you all the time.\\nWhat you must do, then, is mend your ways and get rid of the burden you‟re carrying.\\nKeep your cravings within safe limits. Scour every trace of evil from your personality. If you\\nwant to enjoy your travel, you must make your travelling companion a healthy one. So long as\\nyou associate with a person who‟s mean and grasping you will remain a money-minded\\nindividual yourself. So long as you keep arrogant company, just so long will conceit stick to you.\\nCruelty you‟ll never say goodbye to while you share the same roof with a torturer. Familiarity\\nwith adulterers will only inflame your desires. If you wish to be stripped of your vices you must\\nget right away from the examples others set of them. The miser, the swindler, the bully, the\\ncheat, who would do you a lot of harm by simply being near you, are actually inside you. Move\\nto better company: live with the Catos, with Laelius, with Tubero. If you like Greek company\\ntoo, attach yourself to Socrates and Zeno: the one would teach you how to the should it be forced\\nupon you, the other how to the before it is forced upon you. Live with Chrysippus, live with\\nPosidonius; they will give you a knowledge of man and the universe; they will tell you to be a\\npractical philosopher: not just to entertain your listeners to a clever display of language, but to\\nsteel your spirit and brace it against whatever threatens. For the only safe harbour in this life‟s\\ntossing, troubled sea is to refuse to be bothered about what the future will bring and to stand\\nready and confident, squaring the breast to take without skulking or flinching whatever fortune\\nhurls at us.\\nWhen she created us, nature endowed us with noble aspirations, and just as she gave\\ncertain animals ferocity, others timidity, others cunning, so to us she gave a spirit of exalted\\nambition, a spirit that takes us in search of a life of, not the greatest safety, but the greatest\\nhonour – a spirit very like the universe, which, so far as mortal footsteps may, it follows and\\nadopts as a model. It is self-assertive; it feels assured of honour and respect; it is master of all\\nthings; it is above all things; it should accordingly give in to nothing; in nothing should it see a\\nburden calculated to bow the shoulders of a man.\\nShapes frightening to the sight, Hardship and Death*\\nare not so at all if one can break through the surrounding darkness and look directly at\\nthem. Many are the things that have caused terror during the night and been turned into matters\\nof laughter with the coming of daylight.\\nShapes frightening to the sight, Hardship and Death.\\nOur Virgil perfectly rightly says that they are frightening, not in reality, but „to the sight‟,\\nin other words that they seem so but in fact are not. Just what is there about them that is as\\nterrifying as legend would have us believe? Why, Lucilius, I ask you why should any real man\\nbe afraid of hardship, or any human being be afraid of death? I constantly meet people who think\\nthat what they themselves can‟t do can‟t be done, who say that to bear up under the things we\\nStoics speak of is beyond the capacity of human nature. How much more highly I rate these\\npeople‟s abilities than they do themselves ! I say that they are just as capable as others of doing\\nthese things, but won‟t. In any event what person actually trying them has found them prove\\nbeyond him? Who hasn‟t noticed how much easier they are in the actual doing? It‟s not because\\n\\n\\x0cthey‟re hard that we lose confidence; they‟re hard because we lack the confidence.\\nIf you still need an example, take Socrates, an old man who had known his full share of\\nsuffering, who had taken every blow life could inflict, and still remained unbeaten either by\\npoverty, a burden for him aggravated by domestic worries, or by constant hardships, including\\nthose endured on military service. Apart from what he had to contend with at home – whether\\none thinks of his wife with her shrewish ways and nagging tongue, or his intractable children,\\nmore like their mother than their father – his whole life was lived either in war-time or under\\ntyranny or under a „democracy‟ that outdid even wars and tyrants in its cruelties. The war went\\non for twenty-seven years. After the fighting was ended, the state was handed over to the mercy\\nof the Thirty Tyrants, a considerable number of whom were hostile to him. The final blow was\\nhis conviction and sentence on the most serious of charges: he was accused of blasphemy and of\\ncorrupting the younger generation, whom, it was alleged, he turned into rebels against God, their\\nfathers and the state. After that came the prison and the poison. And so little effect did all this\\nhave on Socrates‟ spirit, it did not even affect the expression on his face. What a rare and\\nwonderful story of achievement! To the very last no one ever saw Socrates in any particular\\nmood of gaiety or depression. Through all the ups and downs of fortune his was a level\\ntemperament.\\nWould you like another example? Take the modern one of Marcus Cato, with whom\\nfortune dealt in an even more belligerent and unremitting fashion. At every point she stood in his\\nway, even at the end, at his death; yet he demonstrated that a brave man can live in defiance of\\nfortune and can the in defiance of fortune. The whole of his life was passed either in civil war or\\nin conditions of developing civil conflict. And of him no less than of Socrates it is possible to say\\nthat he carried himself clear of slavery* (unless, perhaps, you take the view that Pompey, Caesar\\nand Crassus were friends of freedom). When his country was in a state of constant change, no\\none ever saw a change in Cato. In every situation he was placed in, he showed himself always\\nthe same man, whether in office as praetor, in defeat at the polls, under attack in court, as\\ngovernor in his province, on the public platform, in the field, or in death itself. In that moment,\\ntoo, of panic for the Republic, when Caesar stood on the one side, backed by ten legions of the\\nfinest fighting men and the entire resources and support of foreign countries as well, and on the\\nother stood Pompey, by himself a match for all comers, and when people were moving to join\\neither the one or the other, Cato all on his own established something of a party pledged to fight\\nfor the Republic. If you try to picture the period to yourself you will see on the one side the\\npopulace, the mob all agog for revolution, on the other the time-honoured elect of Rome, the\\naristocracy and knighthood; and two forlorn figures, Cato and republicanism, between them. You\\nwill find it an impressive sight, I can assure you, as you watch\\nThe Son of Atreus and King Priam with\\nAchilles wroth with both.†\\nFor there is Cato denouncing each of them, trying to disarm the pair of them. And the\\nway he casts his vote between them is: „If Caesar wins, I kill myself; if Pompey, I go into exile‟\\nWhat had a man to fear who, win or lose, had dictated to himself such a choice of fates as might\\nhave been decreed him by an utterly exasperated enemy? And that is how he came to die,\\ncarrying out his own self-sentence.\\nYou will see, too, the capacity of man for hardship: on foot at the head of his troops he\\ncrossed the deserts of North Africa. You see that thirst can be endured as well: always in armour,\\ntrailing over a sun-baked plateau the remnants of a beaten army, an army without supplies, he\\nwas invariably the last to drink whenever they came upon water. You see that a man can think\\n\\n\\x0cequally little of either the distinction of office or the stigma of rejection: on the day of his\\nelection defeat he played fives at the place of polling. You see that men can defy the might of\\ntheir superiors: for, with no one daring offend either Caesar or Pompey except to curry favour\\nwith the other, Cato challenged the pair of them simultaneously. You see that a man can think as\\nlittle of death as of exile: he condemned himself to both, and war in the meantime.\\nWe, then, can show as spirited an attitude to just the same things if we will only choose to\\nslip the yoke from our necks. But first we have to reject the life of pleasures; they make us soft\\nand womanish; they are insistent in their demands, and what is more, require us to make insistent\\ndemands on fortune. And then we need to look down on wealth, which is the wage of slavery.\\nGold and silver and everything else that clutters our prosperous homes should be discarded.\\nFreedom cannot be won without sacrifice. If you set a high value on her, everything else must be\\nvalued at little.\\n\\nLETTER CV\\nYES, I‟ll give you some rules to observe that will enable you to live in greater safety.\\nYou for your part I suggest should listen as carefully to the advice I give you as you would if I\\nwere advising you on how to look after your health at Ardea.\\nNow think of the things which goad man into destroying man: you‟ll find that they are\\nhope, envy, hatred, fear and contempt. Contempt is the least important of the lot, so much so that\\na number of men have actually taken shelter behind it for protection‟s sake. For if a person feels\\ncontempt for someone, he tramples on him, doubtless, but he passes on. No one pursues an\\nunremitting and persistent policy of injury to a man for whom he feels nothing but contempt.\\nEven in battle the man on the ground is left alone, the fighting being with those still on their feet.\\nComing to hope, so long as you own nothing likely to arouse the greed or grasping instincts of\\nothers, so long as you possess nothing out of the ordinary (for people covet even the smallest\\nthings if they are rare or little known),* you‟ll have nothing to worry about from the hopes of\\ngrasping characters. Envy you‟ll escape if you haven‟t obtruded yourself on other people‟s\\nnotice, if you haven‟t flaunted your possessions, if you‟ve learnt to keep your satisfaction to\\nyourself. Hatred either comes from giving offence, and that you‟ll avoid by refraining from\\ndeliberately provoking anyone, or is quite uncalled for: here your safeguard will be ordinary tact.\\nIt is a kind of hatred that has been a source of danger to a lot of people; men have been hated\\nwithout having any actual enemy. As regards not being feared, a moderate fortune and an\\neasy-going nature will secure you that. People should see that you‟re not a person it is dangerous\\nto offend: and with you a reconciliation should be both easy and dependable. To be feared inside\\nyour own home, it may be added, is as much a source of trouble as being feared outside it – slave\\nor free, there isn‟t a man who hasn‟t power enough to do you injury. Besides, to be feared is to\\nfear: no one has been able to strike terror into others and at the same time enjoy peace of mind\\nhimself. There remains contempt. The person who has made contempt his ally, who has been\\ndespised because he has chosen to be despised, has the measure of it under his control. Its\\ndisadvantages are negatived by the possession of respected qualities and of friends having\\ninfluence with some person with the necessary influence. Such influential friends are people with\\nwhom it is well worth having ties, without being so tied up with them that their protection costs\\nyou more than the original danger might have done.\\nBut nothing will help quite so much as just keeping quiet, talking with other people as\\nlittle as possible, with yourself as much as possible. For conversation has a kind of charm about\\nit, an insinuating and insidious something that elicits secrets from us just like love or liquor.\\n\\n\\x0cNobody will keep the things he hears to himself, and nobody will repeat just what he hears and\\nno more. Neither will anyone who has failed to keep a story to himself keep the name of his\\ninformant to himself. Every person without exception has someone to whom he confides\\neverything that is confided to himself. Even supposing he puts some guard on his garrulous\\ntongue and is content with a single pair of ears, he will be the creator of a host of later listeners –\\nsuch is the way in which what was but a little while before a secret becomes common rumour.\\nNever to wrong others takes one a long way towards peace of mind. People who know no\\nself-restraint lead stormy and disordered lives, passing their time in a state of fear commensurate\\nwith the injuries they do to others, never able to relax. After every act they tremble, paralysed,\\ntheir consciences continually demanding an answer, not allowing them to get on with other\\nthings. To expect punishment is to suffer it; and to earn it is to expect it. Where there is a bad\\nconscience, some circumstance or other may provide one with impunity, but never with freedom\\nfrom anxiety; for a person takes the attitude that even if he isn‟t found out, there‟s always the\\npossibility of it. His sleep is troubled. Whenever he talks about someone else‟s misdeed he thinks\\nof his own, which seems to him all too inadequately hidden, all too inadequately blotted out of\\npeople‟s memories. A guilty person sometimes has the luck to escape detection, but never to feel\\nsure of it.\\n\\nLETTER CVII\\nWHERE‟s that moral insight of yours? Where‟s that acuteness of perception? Or\\nmagnanimity? Does something as trivial as that upset you? Your slaves have seen your\\nabsorption in business as their chance to run away. So be it, you have been let down by friends –\\nfor by all means let them keep the name we mistakenly bestowed on them and be called such just\\nto heighten their disgrace; but the fact is that your affairs have been freed for good and all of a\\nnumber of people on whom all your trouble was being wasted and who considered you\\ninsufferable to anyone but yourself. There‟s nothing unusual or surprising about it all. To be put\\nout by this sort of thing is as ridiculous as grumbling about being spattered in the street or getting\\ndirty where it‟s muddy. One has to accept life on the same terms as the public baths, or crowds,\\nor travel. Things will get thrown at you and things will hit you. Life‟s no soft affair. It‟s a long\\nroad you‟ve started on: you can‟t but expect to have slips and knocks and falls, and get tired, and\\nopenly wish – a lie – for death. At one place you will part from a companion, at another bury\\none, and be afraid of one at another. These are the kind of things you‟ll come up against all along\\nthis rugged journey. Wanting to die? Let the personality be made ready to face everything; let it\\nbe made to realize that it has come to terrain on which thunder and lightning play, terrain on\\nwhich\\nGrief and vengeful Care have set their couch,\\nAnd pallid Sickness dwells, and drear Old Age.*\\nThis is the company in which you must live out your days. Escape them you cannot,\\nscorn them you can. And scorn them you will if by constant reflection you have anticipated\\nfuture happenings. Everyone faces up more bravely to a thing for which he has long prepared\\nhimself, sufferings, even; being withstood if they have been trained for in advance. Those who\\nare unprepared, on the other hand, are panic-stricken by the most insignificant happenings. We\\nmust see to it that nothing takes us by surprise. And since it is invariably unfamiliarity that\\nmakes a thing more formidable than it really is, this habit of continual reflection will ensure that\\nno form of adversity finds you a complete beginner.\\n„I‟ve been deserted by my slaves!‟ Others have been plundered, incriminated, set upon,\\n\\n\\x0cbetrayed, beaten up, attacked with poison or with calumny – mention anything you like, it has\\nhappened to plenty of people. A vast variety of missiles are launched with us as their target.\\nSome are planted in our flesh already, some are hurtling towards us at this very moment, others\\nmerely grazing us in passing on their way to other targets. Let‟s not be taken aback by any of the\\nthings we‟re born to, things no one need complain at for the simple reason that they‟re the same\\nfor everybody. Yes, the same for everybody; for even if a man does escape something, it was a\\nthing which he might have suffered. The fairness of a law does not consist in its effect being\\nactually felt by all alike, but in its having been laid down for all alike. Let‟s get this sense of\\njustice firmly into our heads and pay up without grumbling the taxes arising from our mortal\\nstate. Winter brings in the cold, and we have to shiver; summer brings back the heat and we have\\nto swelter. Bad weather tries the health and we have to be ill. Somewhere or other we are going\\nto have encounters with wild beasts, and with man, too, – more dangerous than all those beasts.\\nFloods will rob us of one thing, fire of another. These are conditions of our existence which we\\ncannot change. What we can do is adopt a noble spirit, such a spirit as befits a good man, so that\\nwe may bear up bravely under all that fortune sends us and bring our wills into tune with\\nnature‟s; reversals, after all, are the means by which nature regulates this visible realm of hers:\\nclear skies follow cloudy; after the calm comes the storm; the winds take turns to blow; day\\nsucceeds night; while part of the heavens is in the ascendant, another is sinking. It is by means of\\nopposites that eternity endures.\\nThis is the law to which our minds are needing to be reconciled. This is the law they\\nshould be following and obeying. They should assume that whatever happens was bound to\\nhappen and refrain from railing at nature. One can do nothing better than endure what cannot be\\ncured and attend uncomplainingly the God at whose instance all things come about. It is a poor\\nsoldier that follows his commander grumbling. So let us receive our orders readily and\\ncheerfully, and not desert the ranks along the march – the march of this glorious fabric of\\ncreation in which everything we shall suffer is a strand. And let us address Jupiter, whose\\nguiding hand directs this mighty work, in the way our own Cleanthes did, in some most\\nexpressive lines which I may perhaps be pardoned for translating in view of the example set here\\nby that master of expressiveness, Cicero. If you like them, so much the better; if not, you will at\\nleast know that I was following Cicero‟s example.\\nLead me, Master of the soaring vault\\nOf Heaven, lead me, Father, where you will.\\nI stand here prompt and eager to obey.\\nAnd ev‟n suppose I were unwilling, still\\nI should attend you and know suffering,\\nDishonourably and grumbling, when I might\\nHave done so and been good as, well. For Fate\\nThe willing leads, the unwilling drags along.*\\nLet us speak and live like that. Let fate find us ready and eager. Here is your noble spirit\\n– the one which has put itself in the hands of fate; on the other side we have the puny degenerate\\nspirit which struggles, and which sees nothing right in the way the universe is ordered, and\\nwould rather reform the gods than reform itself.\\n\\nLETTER CVIII\\nTHE subject you ask me about is one of those in which knowledge has no other\\njustification than the knowledge itself. Nevertheless, and just because it is so justified, you‟re in\\n\\n\\x0ca great hurry and reluctant to wait for the encyclopedia of ethics I‟m compiling at this very\\nmoment. Well, I shall let you have your answer immediately, but first I‟m going to tell you how\\nthis enthusiasm for learning, with which I can see you‟re on fire, is to be brought under control if\\nit isn‟t going to stand in its own way. What is wanted is neither haphazard dipping nor a greedy\\nonslaught on knowledge in the mass. The whole will be reached through its parts, and the burden\\nmust be adjusted to our strength. We mustn‟t take on more than we can manage. You shouldn‟t\\nattempt to absorb all you want to – just what you‟ve room for; simply adopt the right approach\\nand you will end up with room for all you want. The more the mind takes in the more it expands.\\nI remember a piece of advice which Attalus gave me in the days when I practically laid\\nsiege to his lecture hall, always first to arrive and last to go, and would draw him into a\\ndiscussion of some point or other even when he was out taking a walk, for he was always readily\\navailable to his students, not just accessible. „A person teaching and a person learning,‟ he said,\\n„should have the same end in view: the improvement of the latter.‟ A person who goes to a\\nphilosopher should carry away with him something or other of value every day; he should return\\nhome a sounder man or at least more capable of becoming one. And he will: for the power of\\nphilosophy is such that she helps not only those who devote themselves to her but also those who\\ncome into contact with her. A person going out into the sun, whether or not this is what he is\\ngoing out for, will acquire a tan. Customers who sit around rather too long in a shop selling\\nperfumes carry the scent of the place away with them. And people who have been with a\\nphilosopher are bound to have derived from it something of benefit even to the inattentive. Note\\nthat I say the inattentive, not the hostile.\\n„That‟s all very well, but don‟t we all know certain people who have sat at a\\nphilosopher‟s feet year after year without acquiring even a semblance of wisdom?‟ Of course I\\ndo – persevering, conscientious people, too. I prefer to call them a philosopher‟s squatters, not\\nstudents. Some come not to learn but just to hear him, in the same way as we‟re drawn to a\\ntheatre, for the sake of entertainment, to treat our ears to a play, or music, or an address. You‟ll\\nfind that a large proportion of the philosopher‟s audience is made up of this element, which\\nregards his lecture-hall as a place of lodging for periods of leisure. They‟re not concerned to rid\\nthemselves of any faults there, or acquire any rule of life by which to test their characters, but\\nsimply to enjoy to the full the pleasures the ear has to offer. Admittedly some of them actually\\ncome with notebooks, but with a view to recording not the content of the lecture, but words from\\nit – to be passed on to others with the same lack of profit to the hearer as they themselves derived\\nfrom hearing them. Some of them are stirred by the noble sentiments they hear; their faces and\\nspirits light up and they enter into the emotions of the speaker, going into a transport just like the\\neunuch priests who work themselves into a frenzy, to order, at the sound of a Phrygian flute.\\nThey are captivated and aroused not by a din of empty words, but by the splendour of the actual\\ncontent of the speaker‟s words – any expression of bold or spirited defiance of death or fortune\\nmaking you keen to translate what you‟ve heard into action straight away. They are deeply\\naffected by the words and become the persons they are told to be – or would if the impression on\\ntheir minds were to last, if this magnificent enthusiasm were not immediately intercepted by that\\ndiscourager of noble conduct, the crowd: very few succeed in getting home in the same frame of\\nmind.\\nIt is easy enough to arouse in a listener a desire for what is honourable; for in every one\\nof us nature has laid the foundations or sown the seeds of the virtues. We are born to them all, all\\nof us, and when a person comes along with the necessary stimulus, then those qualities of the\\npersonality are awakened, so to speak, from their slumber. Haven‟t you noticed how the theatre\\n\\n\\x0cmurmurs agreement whenever something is spoken the truth of which we generally recognize\\nand unanimously confirm?\\nThe poor lack much, the greedy everything.\\nThe greedy man does no one any good,\\nBut harms no person more than his own self.*\\nYour worst miser will clap these lines and be delighted at hearing his own faults lashed in\\nthis manner. Imagine how much more likely it is that this will happen when such things are being\\nsaid by a philosopher, interspersing passages of sound advice with lines of poetry calculated to\\ndeepen their hold on unenlightened minds. For „the constricting requirements of verse,‟ as\\nCleanthes used to say, „give one‟s meaning all the greater force, in the same way as one‟s breath\\nproduces a far greater noise when it is channelled through a trumpet‟s long and narrow tube\\nbefore its final expulsion through the widening opening at the end.‟ The same things stated in\\nprose are listened to with less attention and have much less impact. When a rhythm is introduced,\\nwhen a fine idea is compressed into a definite metre, the very same thought comes hurtling at\\none like a missile launched from a fully extended arm. A lot, for example, is said about despising\\nmoney. The listener is told at very considerable length that men should look on riches as\\nconsisting in the spirit and not in inherited estates, and that a man is wealthy if he has attuned\\nhimself to his restricted means and has made himself rich on little. But verses such as the\\nfollowing he finds a good deal more striking.\\nHe needs but little who desires but little.\\nHe has his wish, whose wish can be\\nTo have what is enough.\\nWhen we hear these lines and others like them, we feel impelled to admit the truth. The\\npeople for whom nothing is ever enough admire and applaud such a verse and publicly declare\\ntheir distaste for money. When you see them in such a mood, keep at them and drive this home,\\npiling it on them, having nothing to do with plays on words, syllogisms, sophistries and all the\\nother toys of sterile intellectual cleverness. Speak out against the love of money. Speak out\\nagainst extravagance. When you see that you‟ve achieved something and had an effect on your\\nlisteners, lay on all the harder. It is hardly believable how much can be achieved by this sort of\\nspeech, aimed at curing people, wholly directed to the good of the people listening. When the\\ncharacter is impressionable it is easily won over to a passion for what is noble and honourable;\\nwhile a person‟s character is still malleable, and only corrupted to a mild degree, truth strikes\\ndeep if she finds the right kind of advocate.\\nFor my part, at any rate, when I heard Attalus winding up the case against the faults of\\ncharacter, the mistaken attitudes and the evils generally of the lives we lead, I frequently felt a\\nsense of the sorry plight of the human race and looked on him as a kind of sublime being who\\nhad risen higher than the limits of human aspiration. He himself would use the Stoic term „king‟\\nof himself; but to me he seemed more than a king, as being a man who had the right to pass\\njudgement on the conduct and the character of monarchs. And when he began extolling to us the\\nvirtues of poverty and showing us how everything which went beyond our actual needs was just\\nso much unnecessary weight, a burden to the man who had to carry it, I often had a longing to\\nwalk out of that lecture hall a poor man. When he started exposing our pleasures and\\ncommending to us, along with moderation in our diet, physical purity and a mind equally\\nuncontaminated, uncontaminated not only by illicit pleasures but by unnecessary ones as well, I\\nwould become enthusiastic about keeping the appetites for food and drink firmly in their place.\\nWith the result that some of this, Lucilius, has lasted with me right through life. For I started out\\n\\n\\x0con it all with tremendous energy and enthusiasm, and later, after my return to public life, I\\nmanaged to retain a few of the principles as regards which I had made this promising beginning.\\nThis is how I came to give up oysters and mushrooms for the rest of my life (for they are not\\nreally food to us but titbits which induce people who have already had as much as they can take\\nto go on eating – the object most desired by gluttons and others who stuff themselves with more\\nthan they can hold – being items which will come up again as easily as they go down). This too\\nis why throughout life I have always abstained from using scent, as the best smell a body can\\nhave is no smell at all. This is why no wine ever finds its way into my stomach. This is the\\nreason for my life-long avoidance of hot baths, believing as I do that it is effeminate as well as\\npointless to stew one‟s body and exhaust it with continual sweating. Some other things to which\\nI once said good-bye have made their reappearance, but nevertheless, in these cases in which I\\nhave ceased to practise total abstinence, I succeed in observing a limit, which is something\\nhardly more than a step removed from total abstinence (and even perhaps more difficult – with\\nsome things less effort of will is required to cut them out altogether than to have recourse to them\\nin moderation).\\nNow that I‟ve started disclosing to you how much greater my enthusiasm was in taking\\nup philosophy as a young man than it is when it comes to keeping it up in my old age, I shan‟t be\\nashamed to confess the passionate feelings which Pythagoras inspired in me. Sotion used to tell\\nus why Pythagoras, and later Sextius, was a vegetarian. Each had a quite different reason, but\\neach was a striking one. Sextius believed that man had enough food to sustain him without\\nshedding blood, and that when men took this tearing of flesh so far that it became a pleasure a\\nhabit of cruelty was formed. He argued in addition that the scope for people‟s extravagance was\\nin any case something that should be reduced; and he gave reasons for inferring that variety of\\ndiet was incompatible with our physical make-up and inimical to health. Pythagoras, on the other\\nhand, maintained that all creatures were interrelated and that there was a system of exchange of\\nsouls involving transmigration from one bodily form to another. If we are to believe Pythagoras,\\nno soul ever undergoes death, or even a suspension of its existence except perhaps for the actual\\nmoment of transfusion into another body. This is not the moment for inquiring by what stages or\\nat what point a soul completes its wanderings through a succession of other habitations and\\nreverts to human form. It is enough for our present purposes that he has instilled into people a\\ndread of committing the crime of parricide, in view of the possibility that they might, all\\nunknowing, come across the soul of an ancestor and with knife or teeth do it dreadful outrage,\\nassuming that the spirit of a relative might be lodging in the flesh concerned. After setting out\\nthis theory and supplementing it with arguments of his own, Sotion would say, „You cannot\\naccept the idea of souls being assigned to one body after another, and the notion that what we\\ncall death is only a move to another home? You cannot accept that the soul which was once that\\nof a man may sojourn in wild beasts, or in our own domestic animals, or in the creatures of the\\ndeep? You cannot accept that nothing ever perishes on this earth, instead merely undergoing a\\nchange in its whereabouts? And that the animal world, not just the heavenly bodies that revolve\\nin their unalterable tracks, moves in cycles, with its souls propelled along an orbital path of their\\nown? Well, the fact that these ideas are ones which have been accepted by great men should\\nmake you suspend judgement. You should preserve an open mind on the whole subject anyway.\\nFor if these ideas are correct, to abstain from eating the flesh of animals will mean guiltlessness;\\nand even if they are not, it will still mean frugal living. What do you lose by believing in it all?\\nAll I am depriving you of is what the lions and the vultures feed on.‟\\nFired by this teaching I became a vegetarian, and by the time a year had gone by was\\n\\n\\x0cfinding it an enjoyable as well as an easy habit. I was beginning to feel that my mind was more\\nactive as a result of it – though I would not take my oath to you now that it really was. I suppose\\nyou want to know how I came to give up the practice. Well, my years as a young man coincided\\nwith the early part of Tiberius‟ reign, when certain religious cults of foreign origin were being\\npromoted, and among other things abstinence from certain kinds of animal food was regarded as\\nevidence of adherence to such superstitions. So at the request of my father, who did not really\\nfear my being prosecuted, but who detested philosophy, I resumed my normal habits. And in fact\\nhe had little difficulty in persuading me to adopt a fuller diet. Another thing, though, which\\nAttalus used to recommend was a hard mattress; and that is the kind I still use even in my old\\nage, the kind which shows no trace of a body having slept on it. I tell you all this just to show\\nyou the tremendous enthusiasm with which the merest beginner will set about attaining the very\\nhighest goals provided someone gives him the necessary prompting and encouragement. Things\\ntend, in fact, to go wrong; part of the blame lies on the teachers of philosophy, who today teach\\nus how to argue instead of how to live, part on their students, who come to the teachers in the\\nfirst place with a view to developing not their character but their intellect. The result has been the\\ntransformation of philosophy, the study of wisdom, into philology, the study of words.\\nThe object which we have in view, after all, makes a great deal of difference to the\\nmanner in which we approach any subject. If he intends to become a literary scholar, a person\\nexamining his Virgil does not say to himself when he reads that magnificent phrase\\nIrrestorable, Time flies*\\n„We need to bestir ourselves; life will leave us behind unless we make haste; the days are\\nfleeting by, carried away at a gallop, carrying us with them; we fail to realize the pace at which\\nwe are being swept along; here we are making comprehensive plans for the future and generally\\nbehaving as if we had all the leisure in the world when there are precipices all around us.‟ No,\\nhis purpose is to note that Virgil invariably uses this word „flies‟ whenever he speaks of the swift\\npassage of time.\\nLife‟s finest days, for us poor human beings,\\nFly first; the sicknesses and sufferings,\\nA bleak old age, the snatching hand\\nImplacable of merciless death, creep near.†\\nIt is the person with philosophy in his mind who takes these words in the way they are\\nmeant to be taken. „Virgil,‟ he says, „never speaks of the hours as “passing” but as “flying”, this\\nbeing the swiftest form of travel. He is also telling us that the finest ones are the first to be borne\\naway. Then why are we so slow to get ourselves moving so as to be able to keep up with the pace\\nof this swiftest of all things?‟ The best parts of life are flitting by, the worse are to come. The\\nwine which is poured out first is the purest wine in the bottle, the heaviest particles and any\\ncloudiness settling to the bottom. It is just the same with human life. The best comes first Are we\\ngoing to let others drain it so as to keep the dregs for ourselves? Let that sentence stick in your\\nmind, accepted as unquestioningly as if it had been uttered by an oracle:\\nLife‟s finest days, for us poor human beings,\\nFly first.\\nWhy finest? Because what is to come is uncertain. Why finest? Because while we are\\nyoung we are able to learn; when the mind is quick to learn and still susceptible to training we\\ncan turn it to better ends. Because this is a good time for hard work, for studies as a means of\\nkeeping our brains alert and busy and for strenuous activities as a means of exercising our\\nbodies; the time remaining to us afterwards is marked by relative apathy and indolence, and is all\\n\\n\\x0cthe closer to the end. Let us act on this, then, wholeheartedly. Let us cut out all distractions and\\nwork away at this alone for fear that otherwise we may be left behind and only eventually realize\\none day the swiftness of the passage of this fleeting phenomenon, time, which we are powerless\\nto hold back. Every day as it comes should be welcomed and reduced forthwith into our own\\npossession as if it were the finest day imaginable. What flies past has to be seized at.\\nThese thoughts never occur to someone who looks at the lines I have quoted through the\\neyes of our literary scholar. He does not reflect that our first days are our best days for the very\\nreason that „the sicknesses creep near‟, with old age bearing down on us, hovering over our\\nheads whilst our minds are still full of our youth. No, his comment is that Virgil constantly\\ncouples „sicknesses‟ and „old age‟ (and not without good reason, I can tell you: I should describe\\nold age itself as a kind of incurable sickness). The scholar further remarks on the epithet attached\\nto old age, pointing out that the poet speaks in the passage quoted of „bleak old age‟ and in\\nanother passage writes\\nWhere dwell wan Sicknesses and bleak Old Age.*\\nThere is nothing particularly surprising about this way which everyone has of deriving\\nmaterial for his own individual interests from identical subject-matter. In one and the same\\nmeadow the cow looks for grass, the dog for a hare and the stork for a lizard. When a\\ncommentator, a literary man and a devotee of philosophy pick up Cicero‟s book The State, each\\ndirects his attention in different directions. The philosopher finds it astonishing that so much\\ncould have been said in it by way of criticism of justice. The commentator, coming to the very\\nsame reading matter, inserts this sort of footnote: „There are two Roman kings one of whom has\\nno father and another no mother, the mother of Servius being a matter on which there is\\nuncertainty, and Ancus, the grandson of Numa, having no father on record.‟ He observes further\\nthat „the man to whom we give the title Dictator and read about in the history books under the\\nsame name was called the Master of the Commons by the early Romans; this title survives to the\\npresent day in the augural records, and the fact that the person appointed by him as his deputy\\nwas known as the Master of the Knights is evidence that this is correct.‟ He similarly observes\\nthat „Romulus died during an eclipse of the sun‟; that „the right of appeal to the Commons was\\nrecognized as early as the period of the monarchy; there is authority for this in the pontifical\\nrecords, in the opinion of a number of scholars, in particular Fenestella.‟ When the literary\\nscholar goes through the same book, the first thing he records in his notebook is Cicero‟s use of\\nreapse for re ipse, and sepse likewise for se ipse. He then goes on to examine changes in usage\\nover the years. Where, for example, Cicero uses the expression: „Since we have been called back\\nright from the calx by this interruption of his‟, he notes that the calx was the name which the old\\nRomans gave to the finishing line in the stadium that we nowadays call the creta. The next thing\\nhe does is assemble lines from Ennius, and in particular those referring to Scipio of Africa:\\nNone, foe nor Roman, can assess the value\\nOf his succour and do justice to his feats.*\\nFrom this passage the scholar claims to deduce that the word „succour‟ to the early\\nRomans signified the rendering not merely of assistance but of actual services, Ennius saying\\nthat no one, foe or Roman, was capable of assessing the value of the services Scipio rendered\\nRome. Next he congratulates himself on discovering the source from which Virgil chose to take\\nthe following:\\nAbove whose head the mighty gates of heaven\\nThunder.†\\nHe tells us that Ennius filched the idea from Homer and that Virgil filched it from\\n\\n\\x0cEnnius, there being a couplet of Ennius (preserved in this very work of Cicero‟s I was\\nmentioning, The State) which reads\\nIf any man may rise to heaven‟s levels,\\nTo me, alone, lie open heaven‟s huge gates.\\nBut enough, or before I know where I am I shall be slipping into the scholar‟s or\\ncommentator‟s shoes myself. My advice is really this: what we hear the philosophers saying and\\nwhat we find in their writings should be applied in our pursuit of the happy life. We should hunt\\nout the helpful pieces of teaching, and the spirited and noble-minded sayings which are capable\\nof immediate practical application – not far-fetched or archaic expressions or extravagant\\nmetaphors and figures of speech – and learn them so well that words become works. No one to\\nmy mind lets humanity down quite so much as those who study philosophy as if it were a sort of\\ncommercial skill and then proceed to live in a quite different manner from the way they tell other\\npeople to live. People prone to every fault they denounce are walking advertisements of the\\nuselessness of their training. That kind of man can be of no more help to me as an instructor than\\na steersman who is seasick in a storm – a man who should be hanging on to the tiller when the\\nwaves are snatching it from his grasp, wrestling with the sea itself, rescuing his sails from the\\nwinds. What good to me is a vomiting and stupefied helmsman? And you may well think the\\nstorm of life is a great deal more serious than any which ever tosses a boat. What is needed is a\\nsteering hand, not talking. And apart from this, everything which this kind of man says,\\neverything he tosses out to a thronging audience, belongs to someone else. The words were said\\nby Plato, said by Zeno, said by Chrysippus and Posidonius and a whole host more of Stoics like\\nthem. Let me indicate here how men can prove that their words are their own: let them put their\\npreaching into practice.\\nNow that I‟ve given you the message I wanted to convey to you, I‟ll go on from here to\\nsatisfy that wish of yours. But I‟ll transfer what you wanted from me to another, fresh letter, to\\navoid your coming mentally weary to a subject which is a thorny one and needs to be followed\\nwith a conscientious and attentive ear.\\n\\nLETTER CXIV\\nYOU ask why it is that at certain periods a corrupt literary style has come into being; and\\nhow it is that a gifted mind develops a leaning towards some fault or other (resulting in the\\nprevalence at one period of a bombastic form of exposition, at another of an effeminate form,\\nfashioned after the manner of songs); and why it is that at one time approval is won by\\nextravagant conceits and at another by sentences of an abrupt, allusive character that convey\\nmore to the intelligence than to the ear; and why there have been eras in which metaphors have\\nbeen shamelessly exploited. The answer lies in something that you hear commonly enough,\\nsomething which among the Greeks has passed into a proverb: people‟s speech matches their\\nlives. And just as the way in which each individual expresses himself resembles the way he acts,\\nso in the case of a nation of declining morals and given over to luxury forms of expression at any\\ngiven time mirror the general behaviour of that society. A luxuriant literary style, assuming that\\nit is the favoured and accepted style and not just appearing in the odd writer here and there, is a\\nsign of an extravagant society. The spirit and the intellect cannot be of different hues. If the spirit\\nis sound, if it is properly adjusted and has dignity and self-control, the intellect will be sober and\\nsensible too, and if the former is tainted the latter will be infected as well. You‟ve observed\\nsurely, how a person‟s limbs drag and his feet dawdle along if his spirit is a feeble one? And how\\nthe lack of moral fibre shows in his very gait if his spirit is addicted to soft living? And how if\\n\\n\\x0chis spirit is a lively and dashing one his step is brisk? And how if it is a prey to madness or the\\nsimilar state of anger, his body moves along in an uncontrolled sort of way, in a rush rather than\\na walk? Isn‟t this all the more likely to be the case where a person‟s intellect is concerned, his\\nintellect being wholly bound up with his spirit – moulded by and responsive to it and looking to\\nit for guidance?\\nThe manner in which Maecenas lived is too well known for there to be any need to\\ndescribe the way he walked, his self-indulgent nature, his passion for self-display, his reluctance\\nthat his faults should escape people‟s notice. Well, then, wasn‟t his style just as undisciplined as\\nhis dress was sloppy? Wasn‟t his vocabulary just as extraordinary as his turnout, his retinue, his\\nhouse, his wife? He would have been a genius if he had pursued a more direct path instead of\\ngoing out of his way to avoid being intelligible, had he not been as loose in matters of style as he\\nwas in everything else. Which is why you‟ll notice that his eloquence resembles a drunken\\nman‟s, tortuous and rambling and thoroughly eccentric. Could there be a worse expression than\\n„the bank with mane of stream and woods‟? And look at „men tilling with wherries the channel,\\ndriving the gardens back with the shallows‟ churning over‟. What about a person „curvetting at a\\nwoman‟s beck, with lips on billing bent, a sigh the opening of his addresses, neck lolling like a\\nforest giant in his ecstasy‟? „The unregenerate company rummage homes for victuals, raiding\\nthem with provision jars and trading death for hope.‟ „But hardly should I call as witness on his\\nholy day my guardian spirit.‟ „Else the wick of a slender waxlight and sputtering meal.‟ „Mothers\\nor wives accoutre the hearth‟ When you read this sort of thing, doesn‟t it immediately cross your\\nmind that this is the same man who invariably went around with casual clothes on in the capital\\n(even when Maecenas was discharging the emperor‟s duties during the absence of Augustus, the\\nofficer coming to him for the daily codeword would find him in informal attire), who appeared\\non the bench, on the platform and at any public gathering wearing a mantle draped over his head\\nleaving both ears exposed, looking just like the rich man‟s runaway slave as depicted on the\\ncomic stage? The same man whose public escort, at a time when the nation was embroiled in a\\ncivil war and the capital was under arms and in a state of alarm, consisted of a pair of eunuchs,\\nand who went through a thousand ceremonies of marriage with his one wife?\\nThese expressions of his, strung together in such an outrageous fashion, tossed out in\\nsuch a careless manner, constructed with such a total disregard of universal usage, reveal a\\ncharacter equally revolutionary, equally perverted and peculiar. Maecenas‟ greatest claim to\\nglory is regarded as having been his clemency: he spared the sword, refrained from bloodshed\\nand showed his power only in his defiance of convention. But he has spoilt this very claim of his\\nby these monstrous stylistic frolics; for it becomes apparent that he was not a mild man but a soft\\none. That perplexing word order, those transpositions of words and those startling ideas which\\nhave indeed the quality of greatness in them but which lose all their effect in the expression, will\\nmake it obvious to anyone that his head was turned by overmuch prosperity.\\nIt is a fault which is sometimes that of the man and sometimes that of the age. Where\\nprosperity has spread luxury over a wide area of society, people start by paying closer attention\\nto their personal turnout. The next thing that engages people‟s energies is furniture. Then pains\\nare devoted to the houses themselves, so as to have them running out over broad expanses of\\nterritory, to have the walls glowing with marble shipped from overseas and the ceilings picked\\nout in gold, to have the floors shining with a lustre matching the panels overhead. Splendour then\\nmoves on to the table, where praise is courted through the medium of novelty and variations in\\nthe accustomed order of dishes, making what normally rounds off a meal the first course and\\ngiving people as they go what they used before to be given on arrival. Once a person‟s spirit has\\n\\n\\x0cacquired the habit of disdaining what is customary and regards the usual as banal, it starts\\nlooking for novelty in its methods of expression as well. At one moment it will disinter and\\nrevive archaic or obsolete expressions; at another it will coin new, unheard of expressions and\\ngive a word a new form; at another – this is something that has become very common recently –\\nthe bold and frequent use of metaphor passes for good style. There are some who cut their\\nthoughts short and hope to win acclaim by making their meaning elusive, giving their audience a\\nmere hint of it; there are others who stretch them out, reluctant to let them go; there are others\\nstill who do not merely fall into a defect of style (which is something that is inevitable if one is\\nstriving for any lofty effect), but have a passion for the defect for its own sake.\\nSo wherever you notice that a corrupt style is in general favour, you may be certain that\\nin that society people‟s characters as well have deviated from the true path. In the same way as\\nextravagance in dress and entertaining are indications of a diseased community, so an aberrant\\nliterary style, provided it is widespread, shows that the spirit (from which people‟s words derive)\\nhas also come to grief. And in fact you need feel no surprise at the way corrupt work finds\\npopularity not merely with the common bystander but with your relatively cultivated audience:\\nthe distinction between these two classes of critic is more one of dress than of discernment. What\\nyou might find more surprising is the fact that they do not confine themselves to admiring\\npassages that contain defects, but admire the actual defects themselves as well. The former thing\\nhas been the case all through history – no genius that ever won acclaim did so without a measure\\nof indulgence. Name me any man you like who had a celebrated reputation, and I‟ll tell you what\\nthe age he lived in forgave him, what it turned a blind eye to in his work. I‟ll show you plenty of\\nstylists whose faults never did them any harm and some who were actually helped by them. I‟ll\\neven say this: I could show you some men of the highest renown, men held up as objects of\\nwonder and admiration, in whose case to amend their faults would be to destroy them, their\\nfaults being so inextricably bound up with their virtues.\\nBesides, there are no fixed rules of style. They are governed by the usage of society and\\nusage never stands still for any length of time. Many speakers hark back to earlier centuries for\\ntheir vocabulary, talking in the language of the Twelve Tables.* Gracchus, Crassus and Curio are\\ntoo polished and modern for them. They go right back to Appius and Coruncanius. Others, by\\ncontrast, in seeking to confine themselves to familiar, everyday expressions, slip into an\\nundistinguished manner. Both these practices, in their different ways, are debased style (quite as\\nmuch so as the rejection of any expression that is not high-sounding, florid and poetical,\\navoiding the indispensable expressions in normal use). The one is as much a fault as the other, in\\nmy view, the first paying undue attention to itself and the second unduly neglecting itself. The\\nformer removes the hair from its legs as well, the latter not even from its armpits.\\nLet us turn our attention to composition. How many species of fault can I show you\\nwhere this is concerned? Some like it broken and uneven, and go out of their way to disarrange\\nany passage with a relatively smooth and even flow. They want every transition to come with a\\njolt, and see virility and forcefulness in a style the irregularities of which jar the ear. With some\\nother literary figures it is not a case of composition but of setting words to melodies, so sweetly,\\nsoftly do they glide along. What shall I say about the kind in which words are held back and keep\\nus waiting for a long time before they make their reluctant appearance right at the end of the\\nperiod? What of that, like Cicero‟s, which moves to its conclusion in a leisurely fashion, in a\\ngentle and delayed incline, and unvaryingly true to its customary rhythm?\\nIn the field of the epigram, too, faults comprise a tameness and childishness, or a\\nboldness and daring that oversteps the bounds of decency, or a richness that has a cloying\\n\\n\\x0cquality, or a barrenness in the outcome, an ineffectiveness, a ringing quality and nothing more.\\nThese faults are introduced by some individual dominating letters at the time, are copied\\nby the rest and handed on from one person to another. Thus in Sallust‟s heyday abruptly\\nterminated sentences, unexpectedly sudden endings and a brevity carried to the point of obscurity\\npassed for a polished style. Lucius Arruntius, the historian of the Punic War and a man of\\nunusual simplicity of character, was a follower of Sallust and strove after that kind of style. „By\\nmeans of money he procured an army‟, hired one, in other words, is an expression found in\\nSallust. Arruntius took a fancy to this expression „procured‟ and found a place for it on every\\npage, saying in one passage: „They procured our rout‟, in another: „King Hiero of Syracuse\\nprocured a war‟, and in another: „This news procured the surrender of the people of Panormus to\\nthe Romans.‟ These are merely by way of giving you samples of the practice – the whole book is\\nrife with them. What was occasional in Sallust is of frequent, almost incessant occurrence in\\nArruntius, which is easily enough explained, for whereas Sallust hit on such expressions\\nArruntius cultivated them. You can see what the result is when some writer‟s fault is taken as a\\nmodel. Sallust spoke of „wintry rains‟. Arruntius, in the first book of The Punic War, says:\\n„Suddenly the weather was wintry.‟ In another place, when he wants to describe a particular year\\nas having been a cold one, he says: „The whole year was wintry.‟ In another passage he writes:\\n„From there he despatched sixty transport vessels, lightly laden apart from troops and essential\\ncrew, in spite of a wintry northerly gale.‟ He drags the word in constantly, in every conceivable\\nplace. Sallust at one point writes: „Seeking, amid civil war, the plaudits of rectitude and\\nintegrity‟. Arruntius was unable to restrain himself from inserting right at the beginning of his\\nfirst book mention of Regulus‟ tremendous „plaudits‟.\\nNow these faults, and others like them, stamped on a writer‟s style by imitation, are not\\nthemselves evidence of extravagant ways or corrupt attitudes. For the things upon which you\\nbase any judgement on a person‟s psychology must be things peculiar to himself, things that\\nspring from his own nature, a hot-tempered man having a hot-tempered style, an emotional man\\nan over-excited one, a self-indulgent man a soft and flabby one and so on. And the last is the\\nmanner one observes adopted by the sort of person who has his beard plucked out, or has it\\nplucked out in parts, who keeps himself close-shaven and smooth around his lips but leaves the\\nrest of it to grow, who wears cloaks in flamboyant colours, who wears a diaphanous robe, who is\\nreluctant to do anything that might escape people‟s attention, who provokes and courts such\\nattention and so long as he is looked at does not mind whether it is with disapproval. Such is the\\nmanner of Maecenas and every other writer whose stylistic errors are not accidental but\\ndeliberate and calculated. It is something that stems from a serious affliction of the spirit. When a\\nperson is drinking his tongue only starts stumbling after his mental faculties have succumbed and\\ngiven way or broken down. The same applies with this drunkenness – what else can one regard it\\nas? – of style. No one suffers from it unless his spirit is unstable.\\nSee, then, that the spirit is well looked after. Our thoughts and our words proceed from it.\\nWe derive our demeanour and expression and the very way we walk from it. If the spirit is sound\\nand healthy our style will be firm and forceful and virile, but if the spirit tumbles all the rest of\\nour personality comes down in ruins with it.\\nThe queen unharmed, the bees all live at one;\\nOnce she is lost, the hive‟s in anarchy.*\\nThe spirit is our queen. So long as she is unharmed, the rest remains at its post, obedient\\nand submissive. If she wavers for a moment, in the same moment the rest all falters.†\\n\\nLETTER CXXII\\n\\n\\x0cTHE daylight has begun to diminish. It has contracted considerably, but not so much that\\nthere is not a generous amount remaining still for anyone who will, so to speak, rise with the\\ndaylight itself. More active and commendable still is the person who is waiting for the daylight\\nand intercepts the first rays of the sun; shame on him who lies in bed dozing when the sun is high\\nin the sky, whose waking hours commence in the middle of the day – and even this time, for a lot\\nof people, is the equivalent of the small hours. There are some who invert the functions of day\\nand night and do not separate eyelids leaden with the previous day‟s carousal before night sets\\nin. Their way of life, if not their geographical situation, resembles the state of those peoples\\nwhom nature, as Virgil says, has planted beneath our feet on the opposite side of the world\\nAnd when Dawn‟s panting steeds first breathe on us,\\nFor them the reddening Evening starts at length\\nTo light their lamps.‡\\nThere are some antipodes living in the same city as ourselves who, as Marcus Cato said,\\nhave never seen the sun rise or set. Can you imagine that these people know how one ought to\\nlive when they do not know when one ought to live? Can they really be afraid of death like other\\npeople when this is what they have retreated into in their own lifetimes? They are as weird as\\nbirds that fly by night. They may while away their hours of darkness to a background of wine\\nand perfume, they may occupy the whole of the time they spend, contrarily, awake eating\\nsumptuous dishes – individually cooked, too, in a long succession of different courses; but what\\nin fact they are doing is not banqueting but celebrating their own last rites. At least the dead have\\ntheir memorial ceremonies during the daytime. Heavens, though, no day is a long one for a man\\nwho is up and about! Let us expand our life: action is its theme and duty. The night should be\\nkept within bounds, and a proportion of it transferred to the day. Poultry that are being reared for\\nthe table are cooped up in the dark so as to prevent them moving about and make them fatten\\neasily; there they languish, getting no exercise, with the swelling taking possession of their\\nsluggish bodies and the inert fat creeping over them in their magnificent seclusion. And the\\nbodies of these people who have dedicated themselves to the dark have an unsightly look about\\nthem, too, inasmuch as their complexions are unhealthier looking than those of persons who are\\npale through sickness. Frail and feeble with their blanched appearance, in their case the flesh on\\nthe living person is deathlike. And yet I should describe this as the least of their ills. How much\\ndeeper is the darkness in their souls! Their souls are dazed and befogged, envious of the blind!\\nWhat man was ever given eyes for the sake of the dark?\\nDo you ask how the soul comes to have this perverse aversion to daylight and\\ntransference of its whole life to the night-time? All vices are at odds with nature, all abandon the\\nproper order of things. The whole object of luxurious living is the delight it takes in irregular\\nways and in not merely departing from the correct course but going to the farthest point away\\nfrom it, and in eventually even taking a stand diametrically opposed to it. Don‟t you think it‟s\\nliving unnaturally to drink without having eaten, taking liquor into an empty system and going\\non to dinner in a drunken state? Yet this is a failing which is common among young people, who\\ncultivate their capacities to the point of drinking – swilling would be a better description of it – in\\nnaked groups the moment they‟re inside the doors of the public bath-house, every now and then\\nhaving a rub all over to get rid of the perspiration brought on by continually putting down the\\npiping hot liquor. To them drinking after lunch or dinner is a common habit, something only\\ndone by rural worthies and people who don‟t know where the true pleasure lies: the wine that\\ngives a person undiluted enjoyment, they say, is the wine that makes its way into his system\\n\\n\\x0cunobstructed instead of swimming about in his food; intoxication on an empty stomach is the\\nkind that gratifies a man.\\nDon‟t you think it‟s living unnaturally to exchange one‟s clothes for women‟s?* Is it not\\nliving unnaturally to aim at imparting the bloom of youth to a different period of life can there be\\na sorrier or crueller practice than that whereby a boy is never, apparently, allowed to grow up\\ninto a man, in order that he may endure a man‟s attentions for as long as may be? Won‟t even his\\nyears rescue him from the indignity his sex ought to have precluded?\\nIs it not living unnaturally to hanker after roses during the winter, and to force lilies in\\nmidwinter by taking the requisite steps to change their environment and keeping up the\\ntemperature with hot water heating? Is it not living unnaturally to plant orchards on the top of\\ntowers, or to have a forest of trees waving in the wind on the roofs and ridges of one‟s mansions,\\ntheir roots springing at a height which it would have been presumptuous for their crests to reach?\\nIs it not living unnaturally to sink the foundations of hot baths in the sea and consider that one is\\nnot swimming in a refined fashion unless one‟s heated waters are exposed to the waves and\\nstorms? Having started to make a practice of desiring everything contrary to nature‟s habit, they\\nfinally end up by breaking off relations with her altogether. „It‟s daylight: time for bed! All‟s\\nquiet: now for our exercises, now for a drive, now for a meal! The daylight‟s getting nearer: time\\nwe had our dinner! No need to do as the crowd does: to follow the common, well-worn path in\\nlife is a sordid way to behave. Let‟s leave the daytime to the generality of people. Let‟s have\\nearly hours that are exclusively our own‟.\\nThis sort of person is to me as good as dead. After all, how far can a person be from the\\ngrave, and an untimely one at that, if he lives by the light of tapers and torches?* I can recall a\\ngreat many people who led this kind of life at one time, with a former praetor among them, too,\\nAcilius Buta, the man who had squandered an enormous fortune which he had inherited, and\\nwhen he confessed his impoverished state to the emperor Tiberius was met with the remark,\\n„You have woken up rather late.‟ Montanus Julius, a tolerably good poet, noted for his closeness\\nto Tiberius and subsequent fall from favour, who used to give public readings of his verse, took\\ngreat delight in working sunrises and sunsets into his compositions. Hence the remark of Natta\\nPinarius when someone was expressing disgust at the way Montanus‟ reading had continued for\\na whole day and declaring that his readings weren‟t worth attending: „I‟m quite prepared to listen\\nto him – can I say fairer than this – from sunrise to sunset.‟ When Montanus had just read the\\nlines\\nThe sun god starts his fiery flames to extend,\\nThe rosy dawn to diffuse her light, and now\\nThat plaintive bird, the swallow, starts to thrust\\nHer morsels down the throats of nestlings shrill,\\nWith gentle bill supplying each its share,\\nWith journeys yet to come,\\none Varus called out, „And Buta starts to sleep.‟ Varus was a Roman knight, a friend of\\nMarcus Vinicius, who was always in attendance at good dinners, for which he used to qualify by\\nthe sauciness of his tongue. It was he, too, who said a little later on when Montanus had read\\nThe herdsmen now in byres have stalled their beasts,\\nAnd night now starts to bring the drowsy world\\nA dreamy stillness,\\n„What‟s that you say? Night, is it, now? I‟ll go and pay a morning call on Buta.‟\\nButa‟s upside-down way of life was a byword, and yet, as I‟ve said, at one time this sort\\n\\n\\x0cof life was led by a great many people. The reason why some people live in this sort of way is\\nnot that they think that night in itself has any special attraction, but that they get no pleasure out\\nof anything which is usual; apart from the fact that daylight is anathema to a bad conscience, a\\nperson who experiences a craving or a contempt for things in proportion to their costliness or\\ncheapness looks down his nose at a form of illumination which does not cost him anything.\\nMoreover the man who lives extravagantly wants his manner of living to be on everybody‟s lips\\nas long as he is alive. He thinks he is wasting his time if he is not being talked about. So every\\nnow and then he does something calculated to set people talking. Plenty of people squander\\nfortunes, plenty of people keep mistresses. To win any reputation in this sort of company you\\nneed to go in for something not just extravagant but really out of the ordinary. In a society as\\nhectic as this one it takes more than common profligacy to get oneself talked about.\\nI once heard that delightful story-teller, Albinovanus Pedo, describing how he had lived\\nabove Sextus Papinius. Papinius was one of the daylight-shy fraternity. „About nine o‟clock at\\nnight I‟d hear the sound of whips. “What‟s he doing?” I‟d ask, and be told he was inspecting the\\nhousehold accounts. About twelve I‟d hear some strenuous shouting. “What‟s that?” I‟d ask, and\\nbe told he was doing his voice exercises. About two I‟d ask what the noise of wheels meant, and\\nbe told he was off for his drive. About daybreak there would be a scurrying in all directions, a\\nshouting for boys and a chaos of activity among stewards and kitchen staff. “What is it?” I‟d ask,\\nto be told he was out of his bath and had called for his pre-dinner appetizer. “His dinner, then,” it\\nmight be said, “exceeded the capacity of his day.” Far from it, for he lived in a highly\\neconomical fashion: all he used to burn up was the night.‟ Hence Pedo‟s remark when some\\npeople were describing Papinius as being mean and grasping: „I take it you would describe him\\nas being an artificial light addict as well.‟\\nYou needn‟t be surprised to discover so much individuality where the vices are\\nconcerned. Vices are manifold, take countless different forms and are incapable of classification.\\nDevotion to what is right is simple, devotion to what is wrong is complex and admits of infinite\\nvariations. It is the same with people‟s characters; in those who follow nature they are\\nstraightforward and uncomplicated, and differ only in minor degree, while those that are warped\\nare hopelessly at odds with the rest and equally at odds with themselves. But the chief cause of\\nthis disease, in my opinion, is an attitude of disdain for a normal existence. These people seek to\\nset themselves apart from the rest of the world even in the manner in which they organize their\\ntime-table, in just the same way as they mark themselves off from others by the way they dress,\\nby the stylishness of their entertaining and the elegance of their carriages. People who regard\\nnotoriety as a reward for misbehaviour have no inclination for common forms of misbehaviour.\\nAnd notoriety is the aim of all these people who live, so to speak, back to front. We therefore,\\nLucilius, should keep to the path which nature has mapped out for us and never diverge from it.\\nFor those who follow nature everything is easy and straightforward, whereas for those who fight\\nagainst her life is just like rowing against the stream.\\n\\nLETTER CXXIII\\nI‟VE reached my house at Alba at last, late at night and worn out by the journey (which\\nwasn‟t so much long as thoroughly uncomfortable) to find nothing ready for my arrival – apart\\nfrom myself. So I‟m in bed, recovering from my fatigue, and making the best of this slowness on\\nthe part of the cook and the baker by carrying on a conversation with myself on this very theme,\\nof how nothing is burdensome if taken lightly, and how nothing need arouse one‟s irritation so\\nlong as one doesn‟t make it bigger than it is by getting irritated. My baker may be out of bread,\\n\\n\\x0cbut the farm manager will have some, or the steward, or a tenant. „Bad bread, yes!‟ you‟ll say.\\nWait, then: it‟ll soon turn into good bread. Hunger will make you find even that bread soft and\\nwheaty. One shouldn‟t, accordingly, eat until hunger demands. I shall wait, then, and not eat\\nuntil I either start getting good bread again or cease to be fussy about bad bread. It is essential to\\nmake oneself used to putting up with a little. Even the wealthy and the well provided are\\ncontinually met and frustrated by difficult times and situations. It is in no man‟s power to have\\nwhatever he wants; but he has it in his power not to wish for what he hasn‟t got, and cheerfully\\nmake the most of the things that do come his way. And a stomach firmly under control, one that\\nwill put up with hard usage, marks a considerable step towards independence.\\nI‟m deriving immeasurable satisfaction from the way my tiredness is becoming\\nreconciled to itself. I‟m not asking for masseurs, or a hot bath, or any remedy except time. What\\nwas brought on by exertion rest is taking away. And whatever kind of meal is on the way is\\ngoing to beat an inaugural banquet for enjoyment. I have, in fact, put my spirit to a sort of test,\\nand a surprise one, too – such a test being a good deal more candid and revealing. When the\\nspirit has prepared itself beforehand, has called on itself in advance to show endurance, it is not\\nso clear just how much real strength it possesses; the surest indications are the ones it gives on\\nthe spur of the moment, when it views annoyances in a manner not merely unruffled but serene,\\nwhen it refrains from flying into a fit of temper or picking a quarrel with someone, when it sees\\nto everything it requires by refraining from hankering after this and that, reflecting that one of its\\nhabits may miss a thing, but its own real self need never do so. Until we have begun to go\\nwithout them, we fail to realize how unnecessary many things are. We‟ve been using them not\\nbecause we needed them but because we had them. Look at the number of things we buy because\\nothers have bought them or because they‟re in most people‟s houses. One of the causes of the\\ntroubles that beset us is the way our lives are guided by the example of others; instead of being\\nset to rights by reason we‟re seduced by convention. There are things that we shouldn‟t wish to\\nimitate if they were done by only a few, but when a lot of people have started doing them we\\nfollow along, as though a practice became more respectable by becoming more common. Once\\nthey have become general, mistaken ways acquire in our minds the status of correct ones.\\nNobody travels now without a troop of Numidian horsemen riding ahead of him and a host of\\nrunners preceding his carriage. One feels ashamed not to have men with one to hustle oncoming\\ntravellers off the road and to show there‟s a gentleman coming by the cloud of dust they raise.\\nEverybody nowadays has mules to carry his crystal-ware, his myrrhine vessels and the other\\narticles engraved by the hands of master craftsmen. One is ashamed to be seen to have only the\\nkind of baggage which can be jolted around without coming to any harm. Everyone‟s pages ride\\nalong with their faces smeared with cream in case the sun or the cold should spoil their delicate\\ncomplexions; one is ashamed if there is no member of one‟s retinue of boys whose healthy\\ncheeks call for protection with cosmetics.\\nWith all such people you should avoid associating. These are the people who pass on\\nvices, transmitting them from one character to another. One used to think that the type of person\\nwho spreads tales was as bad as any: but there are persons who spread vices. And association\\nwith them does a lot of damage. For even if its success is not immediate, it leaves a seed in the\\nmind, and even after we‟ve said goodbye to them, the evil follows us, to rear its head at some\\ntime or other in the future. In the same way as people who‟ve been to a concert carry about with\\nthem the melody and haunting quality of pieces they‟ve just heard, interfering with their thinking\\nand preventing them from concentrating on anything serious, so the talk of snobs and parasites\\nsticks in our ears long after we‟ve heard it. And it‟s far from easy to eradicate these haunting\\n\\n\\x0cnotes from the memory; they stay with us, lasting on and on, coming back to us every so often.\\nThis is why we must shut our ears against mischievous talk, and as soon as it starts, too; once\\nsuch talk has made its entry and been allowed inside, it becomes a good deal bolder. Eventually\\nit reaches the stage where it says that „virtue and philosophy and justice are just a lot of clap-trap.\\nThere‟s only one way to be happy and that‟s to make the most of life. Eating, drinking, spending\\nthe money that‟s been left to you, that‟s what I call living – and that‟s what I call not forgetting\\nthat you‟ve got to die some day, too. The days are slipping by, and life is running out on us,\\nnever to be restored. Why should we hesitate? What‟s the point of being wise? Our years won‟t\\nalways allow us a life of pleasure, and in the meantime while they‟re capable of it and\\nclamouring for it, what‟s the point of thrusting austerity on them? Steal a march on death by\\ndisposing here and now of whatever he is going to take away. Look at you – no mistress, no boy\\nto make your mistress jealous. Every day you go out sober. You eat as if you had to submit a\\ndaily account book to your father for approval. That‟s not living – that‟s merely being a part of\\nthe life enjoyed by other people. And what madness it is to deny yourself everything and so build\\nup a fortune for your heir, a policy which has the effect of actually turning a friend into an\\nenemy, through the very amount that you‟re going to leave him, for the more he‟s going to get\\nthe more gleeful he‟s going to be at your death. As for those sour and disapproving characters,\\nthose critics of other people‟s lives – and spoilers of their own – who set themselves up as moral\\ntutors to society at large, you needn‟t give tuppence for them; you needn‟t ever have any\\nhesitation when it comes to putting good living before a good reputation.‟\\nThese are voices you must steer clear of like those which Ulysses refused to sail past until\\nhe was lashed to the mast. They have the same power: they lure men away from country, parents,\\nfriends and moral values, creating expectations in them only to make sport out of the\\nwretchedness of lives of degradation.* How much better to pursue a straight course and\\neventually reach that destination where the things that are pleasant and the things that are\\nhonourable finally become, for you, the same. And we can achieve this if we realize that there\\nare two classes of things attracting or repelling us. We are attracted by wealth, pleasures, good\\nlooks, political advancement and various other welcoming and enticing prospects: we are\\nrepelled by exertion, death, pain, disgrace and limited means. It follows that we need to train\\nourselves not to crave for the former and not to be afraid of the latter. Let us fight the battle the\\nother way round – retreat from the things that attract us and rouse ourselves to meet the things\\nthat actually attack us. You know the difference, Lucilius, between the postures people adopt in\\nclimbing up and descending a mountain; those coming down a slope lean back, those moving\\nsteeply upwards lean forward, for to tilt one‟s weight ahead of one when descending, and\\nbackwards when ascending, is to be in league with what one has to contend with. The path that\\nleads to pleasures is the downward one: the upward climb is the one that takes us to rugged and\\ndifficult ground. Here let us throw our bodies forward, in the other direction rein them back.\\nAre you now supposing that the only people I consider a danger to our ears are the ones\\nwho glorify pleasure and inculcate in us a dread (itself a fearsome thing) of pain? No, I think\\nwe‟re also damaged by the people who urge us under colour of Stoic beliefs to do what‟s wrong.\\nThey make much of our principle that only a man of wisdom and experience can really love.\\n„He‟s the one man with a natural gift for the art of love-making, then,‟ they say, „and he‟s\\nequally in the best position to know all about drink and parties. Well, here‟s a question for\\ndiscussion: up to what age is it proper to love young men?‟\\nThis sort of thing may be all right for the Greeks, but the kind of talk to which we would\\nbe better to turn our ears is this: „No man‟s good by accident. Virtue has to be learnt. Pleasure is\\n\\n\\x0ca poor and petty thing. No value should be set on it: it‟s something we share with dumb animals\\n– the minutest, most insignificant creatures scutter after it. Glory‟s an empty, changeable thing,\\nas fickle as the weather. Poverty‟s no evil to anyone unless he kicks against it. Death is not an\\nevil. What is it then? The one law mankind has that is free of all discrimination. Superstition is\\nan idiotic heresy: it fears those it should love: it dishonours those it worships. For what\\ndifference does it make whether you deny the gods or bring them into disrepute?‟ These are\\nthings which should be learnt and not just learnt but learnt by heart. Philosophy has no business\\nto supply vice with excuses; a sick man who is encouraged to live in a reckless manner by his\\ndoctor has not a hope of getting well.\\n\\n\\x0cNOTES\\nSENECA’S LIFE\\n1. The date of Seneca‟s birth is not known. Scholars have tended to place it in either 5 or\\n4 B.C., although some have put it as early as 8 B.C. or as late as A.D. 4.\\n2. A procurator was a kind of commissioner or agent, as a rule mainly concerned with\\nrevenue collection, although he might hold high administrative rank. Some provinces had a\\nprocurator as their governor.\\n3. He wrote two handbooks on the subject for his sons. These, the Suasoriae and\\nControversiae, acquired a wide reputation and have survived to the present day.\\n4. Antiquus rigor, as he calls it, writing to his mother (ad Helviam Matrem, 17.3).\\n5.

Suetonius (Caligula, 53) says the emperor disparagingly called him a mere „text-book\\norator‟, his style „sand without cement‟ (arena sine calce).\\n8. Dio, Roman History, LIX:19.\\n9. A fragment of Suetonius (as quoted by the scholiast on Juvenal, Satires, V:109) states\\nthat Seneca was exiled on the pretext of his being linked with the scandalous love affairs of Julia\\nLivilla (quasi conscius adulteriorum Juliae). Dio (Roman History, LX:8) too speaks as if Seneca\\nwas only an incidental victim, the accusation originating in Messalina‟s jealousy of Julia (a sister\\nof Agrippina, and apparently a beautiful and cultivated woman).\\n10. Tacitus, Annals, XIII:8.\\n11. ibid., XIII:3.\\n12. „For five years Nero was so great a ruler, from the point of view of Rome‟s\\ndevelopment and progress, that Trajan‟s frequent claim that no emperor came near Nero in this\\nfive year period can be fully justified‟, to paraphrase the words of Aurelius Victor, de\\nCaesaribus, 5, ii (Nero… quinquennium tamen tantus fuit, agenda urbe maxima, uti merito\\nTrajanus saepius testaretur procul differe cunctos principes Neronis quinquennio). It should be\\nadded that not all historians are agreed that the quinquennium Neronis refers to the first five\\nyears of his rule.\\n13. Roman History, LXI:3.\\n14. Annals, XIII:6.\\n15.

Grimal, The Civilization of Rome. Seneca‟s American translator, Gummere, suggests\\nthat this anomalous state of affairs may be seen as an experiment with Plato‟s ideal of\\nphilosopher-kingship, and one which also took account of the conditions of the time, striking a\\nbalance between the dangers of one-man rule (of which the recent reign of Caligula was a vivid\\nillustration) and the impossibility of a return to the free elections and near anarchy of the\\nRepublic; he describes the result as a kind of cabinet system in which Seneca was the cabinet.\\n19. Tacitus, Annals, XIII:42 and Dio, Roman History, LXI:10 are our sources for the sort\\n\\n\\x0cof thing that was becoming gossip.\\n20. Satires, X:16. Tacitus (Annals, XV:64) also used this word praedives, „immensely\\nwealthy‟, of Seneca, who was almost certainly a millionaire, in terms of sterling, four or five\\ntimes over. Juvenal incidentally speaks of his generosity with his money as if it was well known\\neven after he was dead (Satires, V:109).\\n21. Roman History, LX:32. This historian states that Seneca‟s sudden recall, backed by\\nforce, of enormous sums of money which he had lent to leading natives of the recently\\nconquered province of Britain was a cause of the rising of Buduica or Boudicca („Boadicea‟) in\\nA.D. 61.\\n22. Res Rustica, III:3.3.\\n23. In Letters CVIII and LXXXIII, for example. In Letter LXXXVII he describes an\\nexpedition undertaken by himself and a close friend (Caesonius Maximus, himself a man who\\nhad had a distinguished career) in a mule-cart with the simplest of sleeping equipment and only\\nfigs or bread to eat; he speaks of having had „a blissful two days‟, but regrets to report that he\\ncould not help blushing whenever they met people travelling in greater style (cf. p. 228).\\n24. Roman History, LXI:18. Dio, usually hostile to Seneca, reports „many reliable\\nsources‟ as saying that Seneca helped incite Nero to liquidate Agrippina (Roman History,\\nLXI:12).\\nThe murder, its significance, and the possibility (remote) of Seneca‟s complicity are\\ndiscussed by S. J. Batomsky and P. J. Bicknell in Theoria, volume 19 (1962) pp. 32–6 and\\nvolume 21 (1963) pp. 42–5 (University of Natal Press).\\n25.

The passage is given on p. 243 in Michael Grant‟s translation, from\\nthe Penguin Classics Tacitus: The Annals of Imperial Rome. It incidentally illustrates (like the\\nbeginning of Letter CIV) the close affection between him and his young second wife. There is a\\nrather touching mention in his treatise entitled Anger of how his first wife, after the light was out\\nfor the night, would keep quiet while he made his customary review of everything he had done or\\nsaid in the course of the day (De Ira, III:36).\\n29. Augustine (De Civitate Dei, VI:10) says that Seneca quod culpabat adorabat,\\n„worshipped the very things he criticized‟. Milton speaks of him as ‘in his books a philosopher‟.\\nLa Rochefoucauld, for the frontispiece of an edition of his Réflexions, has him portrayed with\\nvillainous features from which a figure of Cupid representing L’Amour de la Vérité has just\\nstripped a mask of virtuous amiability.\\n30.

The Stoics were considered by many as contumaces… ac refractarios, contemptores\\nmagistratuum aut regum eorumve per quos publica administrantur, „hostile to authority and\\nresistant to discipline, disdainful of kings, magistrates or public officials‟ (Letter LXXIII). There\\nare a number of cases of Stoics whose lack of respect for emperors earned them martyrdom.\\n33. Letter XLVIII.\\n34. Letter LVII. Compare Letter VI.\\n35. A few examples of sayings or ideas so paralleled are those of 1 Cor. iii, 16 (God‟s\\n\\n\\x0c„indwelling presence‟ – cf. Letter XLI, init.); 1 Tim. vi, 10 („money the root of all evil‟); Job i,\\n21 (we came into the world naked and go out of it naked, and ‘the Lord gave, and the Lord hath\\ntaken away’); Rom. xii, 5, 10 (we are members of one body, and ‘Be kindly affectioned one to\\nanother with brotherly love’, etc.); Acts xvii, 29 (God is not like any gold or silver image); Heb.\\niv, 13 (not even thoughts are hidden from God – cf. Letter LXXXIII, init); Matt. v, 45 (the sun\\nrises on the wicked as well); and (as translated in the New English Bible) Eph. v, 1 (imitate, try\\nto be like God). They do not lend any real support to theories that Seneca was influenced by St\\nPaul or by Christian slaves in his own household.\\n36. Dr Basore.\\n37. Letter LXXV. Cf. „Philosophy teaches us to act, not to talk‟ (Letter XX).\\n\\nSENECA AND LITERATURE\\n38. The introduction to the translation Four Tragedies and Octavia by E. F. Watling\\n(Penguin Classics) discusses generally the faults of Senecan drama and the question whether it\\nwas performable.\\n39. See, for example, Duff, Literary History of Rome in the Silver Age.\\n40. There are isolated passages of magnificent writing, poetic or polemic, for example in\\nparts of Letters XC and CIV.\\n41. For instance in Letters XC, XCIV and XCV. The last two incidentally (which discuss\\nthe question whether, in order to enable them to know what is the right thing to do in a given\\nsituation, people need a general „doctrine‟ or a sufficient number of „precepts‟, or both) are\\nsufficient answer in themselves to critics who have said that Seneca is incapable of setting out a\\nsustained, continuous, consistent argument. One might quote here the opinions of Coleridge:\\n„You may get a motto for every sect in religion, but nothing is ever thought out by him‟, and\\nQuintilian: „As a philosopher he was rather slipshod, though a magnificent censor of moral\\nfaults‟ (in philosophia parum diligens, egregius tamen vitiorum insectator, Institutio Oratoria,\\nX:1.129).\\n42. In Letters CXV (e.g. quaere quid scribas, non quemadmodum, „consider what, not\\nhow you should write‟), C and elsewhere.\\n43. Duff, Literary History of Rome in the Silver Age.\\n44. Institutio Oratoria, X:1.125–31 forms throughout an interesting appraisal of Seneca\\nby a famous scholar, advocate and teacher who died only thirty years or so after him. A short,\\nlate seventeenth-century comment on Seneca‟s style is that to be found in Aubrey‟s Lives: „Dr\\nKettle was wont to say that “Seneca writes, as a boare does pisse”, scilicet, by jirkes.‟\\n45. Oratio certam regulam non habet, since fashion or usage (consuetude) is constantly\\naltering the rules (Letter CXIV).\\n46. Aulus Gellius, to give another example, described his language as „trite and\\ncommonplace‟ (vulgaria et protrita), his learning as being „of a very ordinary, low-brow\\ncharacter‟ (vernacula et plebeia).\\n47. Dante quotes him frequently and ranks him (with Cicero) after Virgil only in the\\nInferno. Chaucer, in the Parson’s Tale, classes Seneca with St Paul, Solomon and St Augustine.\\nPetrarch modelled his letters on Seneca‟s, which he knew intimately. The University of Piacenza\\nwas actually endowed with a Professor of Seneca.\\n48. Erasmus put many quotations from Seneca‟s prose works into an anthology known as\\nthe Adagia which has been supposed to be the source of most of the imitations or borrowings\\nfound in Elizabethan writers.\\n\\n\\x0c49. Montaigne (Essays, 1:26) says „I have never got to grips with a single solid book,\\napart from Plutarch and Seneca, from whom I draw unceasingly, for ever dipping and emptying\\nmy pitcher like the daughters of Danaus‟ (who were set to fill a leaking jar as punishment in\\nHades).\\nMuret, his teacher, was also a devoted admirer and editor of Seneca, and Montaigne‟s\\nbrother-in-law, Geoffrey de la Chassaigne, made a translation of him. Lipsius, who edited (1605)\\nand lectured on Seneca, was a correspondent of Montaigne.\\n50. „She was wont to soothe her ruffled temper with reading every morning, when she\\nhad been stirred to passion at the Council, or other matters had overthrown her gracious\\ndisposition. She did much admire Seneca‟s wholesome advisings when the soul‟s quiet is fled\\naway, and I saw much of her translating thereof.‟\\n51. F. L. Lucas, Seneca and Elizabethan Tragedy (Cambridge, 1922). This book and\\nthose by T. S. Eliot and E. F. Watling mentioned below (p. 241) will carry any interested reader\\nwell into the subject.\\n52. Between 1595 and 1620 his popularity rises even above Cicero‟s, and his influence is\\nseen in Lyly, Nashe, Daniel, Lodge (his first English translator), Bacon, Herrick, Donne (who\\ncalls him „that great moral man Seneca‟), Ben Jonson, Henry Vaughan, Cowley, Burton, Rubens,\\nDryden, Pepys and Pope. G. Williamson‟s The Senecan Amble (Chicago, 1951) and R. G.\\nPalmer‟s Seneca’s De Remediis Fortuitorum and the Elizabethans (Chicago, 1953) are full of\\nexamples of Seneca‟s little known mark on English literature.\\n\\nLETTERS\\n53. A lawyer‟s joke. Pacuvius served there for many years as deputy to a governor who\\nwas never permitted to go to his province by the emperor Tiberius. Roman law, like ours, had a\\ndoctrine of title by prescription, that is to say, the legally recognized ownership of land\\nnotwithstanding, sometimes, evidence that the occupier or „squatter‟ is not the true owner, after\\nsufficiently long occupation of it.\\n54. Cf. Letter LXX. „You must not think that only great men have possessed the strength\\nto batter down the imprisoning walls of human servitude. You must not think that this can only\\nbe done by a man like Cato, who tore the life out of himself with his bare hands after failing to\\ndespatch it with a sword. Men of the lowliest rank have made the great effort and won\\ndeliverance; and in circumstances which did not allow them to die as and when convenient to\\nthemselves, which did not permit them any choice in the selection of the means of death, they\\nseized on anything that came to hand and by dint of violence made weapons out of objects of a\\nnormally quite harmless nature.\\n„There is the recent example of one of the Germans being trained to fight beasts in the\\narena who, during practice for the morning show, retired to relieve himself; this was the only\\nprivacy allowed him, a guard otherwise invariably being present. In the lavatory he got hold of a\\nrod with a sponge fixed on the end of it, put there for cleaning purposes, and stuffed the whole of\\nit down his throat and choked himself to death.… Recently, again, a man was travelling on a\\nwagon, under escort, to the morning show. He pretended to be nodding heavily with sleep and let\\nhis head drop until he was able to thrust it in between the spokes, and then hung on to his seat\\njust long enough for the revolving wheel to break his neck, so escaping his punishment by means\\nof the very vehicle on which he was being carried to it.‟\\n55. Seneca here appears to misquote Virgil, who in our editions speaks of „the phases of\\nthe moon‟ and not „the stars‟. Virgil‟s lines are actually part of a passage devoted to weather\\n\\n\\x0csigns.\\n56. The story that Diogenes (the famous Cynic philosopher who lived in ostentatious\\npoverty in Athens) slept in a tub no doubt dates from a time when the size of some Greek\\nearthenware jars had been forgotten.

Gavius Silvanus replied that he had\\nnoticed no signs of fear or sadness in his words or features. So Silvanus was ordered to go back\\nand notify the deathsentence. According to one source, he did not return by the way he had come\\nbut made a detour to visit the commander of the Guard, Faenius Rufus; he showed Faenius the\\nemperor‟s orders asking if he should obey them; and Faenius, with that ineluctable weakness\\nwhich they all revealed, told him to obey. For Silvanus was himself one of the conspirators – and\\nnow he was adding to the crimes which he had conspired to avenge. But he shirked\\ncommunicating or witnessing the atrocity. Instead he sent in one of his staff-officers to tell\\nSeneca he must die.\\nUnperturbed, Seneca asked for his will. But the officer refused. Then Seneca turned to his\\nfriends. „Being forbidden‟, he said, „to show gratitude for your services, I leave you my one\\nremaining possession, and my best: the pattern of my life. If you remember it, your devoted\\nfriendship will be rewarded by a name for virtuous accomplishments.‟ As he talked – and\\nsometimes in sterner and more imperative terms – he checked their tears and sought to revive\\ntheir courage. Where had their philosophy gone, he asked, and that resolution against impending\\nmisfortunes which they had devised over so many years? „surely nobody was unaware that Nero\\nwas cruel!‟ he added. „After murdering his mother and brother, it only remained for him to kill\\nhis teacher and tutor.‟\\nThese words were evidently intended for public hearing. Then Seneca embraced his wife\\nand, with a tenderness very different from his philosophical imperturbability, entreated her to\\nmoderate and set a term to her grief, and take just consolation, in her bereavement, from\\ncontemplating his well-spent life. Nevertheless, she insisted on dying with him, and demanded\\nthe executioner‟s stroke. Seneca did not oppose her brave decision. Indeed, loving her\\nwholeheartedly, he was reluctant to leave her for ill-treatment. „Solace in life was what I\\ncommended to you‟, he said. „But you prefer death and glory. I will not grudge your setting so\\nfine an example. We can die with equal fortitude. But yours will be the nobler end.‟\\nThen, each with one incision of the blade, he and his wife cut their arms. But Seneca‟s\\naged body, lean from austere living, released the blood too slowly. So he also severed the veins\\nin his ankles and behind his knees. Exhausted by severe pain, he was afraid of weakening his\\nwife‟s endurance by betraying his agony – or of losing his own self-possession at the sight of her\\nsufferings. So he asked her to go into another bedroom. But even in his last moment his\\neloquence remained. Summoning secretaries, he dictated a dissertation. (It has been published in\\nhis own words, so I shall refrain from paraphrasing it.)\\nNero did not dislike Paulina personally. In order, therefore, to avoid increasing his\\nill-repute for cruelty, he ordered her suicide to be averted. So on instructions from the soldiers,\\nslaves and ex-slaves bandaged her arms and stopped the bleeding. She may have been\\nunconscious. But discreditable versions are always popular, and some took a different view –\\nthat as long as she feared there was no appeasing Nero, she coveted the distinction of dying with\\nher husband, but when better prospects appeared life‟s attractions got the better of her. She lived\\non for a few years, honourably loyal to her husband‟s memory, with pallid features and limbs\\nwhich showed how much vital blood she had lost\\n\\n\\x0cMeanwhile Seneca‟s death was slow and lingering. Poison, such as was formerly used to\\nexecute state criminals at Athens, had long been prepared; and Seneca now entreated his\\nwell-tried doctor, who was also an old friend, to supply it. But when it came, Seneca drank it\\nwithout effect. For his limbs were already cold and numbed against the poison‟s action. Finally\\nhe was placed in a bath of warm water. He sprinkled a little of it on the attendant slaves,\\ncommenting that this was his libation to Jupiter. Then he was carried into a vapourbath, where he\\nsuffocated. His cremation was without ceremony, in accordance with his own instructions about\\nhis death – written at the height of his wealth and power.\\n(Translated by Michael Grant)\\n\\n\\x0cINDEX OF PERSONS AND PLACES\\nAchaea, the southern part of Greece, forming a separate province of the Roman Empire, a\\nprovince of which Seneca‟s elder brother Gallio was the governor in A.D. 50–51, 184.\\nAcherusian Lake, the, in Campania, 107.\\nAchilles, hero in the war of the Greeks against Priam‟s Troy; his anger with Agamemnon,\\nthe son of Atreus and leader of the Greek forces, is the foundation of the plot of Homer‟s Iliad,\\n152, 193.\\nAegialus, a celebrated vine-grower, 148–50.\\nAeneas, the hero of Virgil‟s epic poem, the Aeneid, 159.\\nAlba, or Alba Longa, an ancient place where Seneca had a country house, some twelve\\nmiles from Rome; the modern Castel Gandolfo, 226.\\nAlexander of Macedon or Alexander the Great, famous conqueror (356–323 B.C.) who\\ncarried Greek arms and culture to the farthest parts of the Middle East and even into India, 103,\\n143, 182.\\nAlexandria, founded by the above, important commercial city and centre of learning,\\ncapital of Egypt, 124.\\nAnacharsis, who lived in the early sixth century B.C., was one of the later so-called\\nSeven Wise Men of antiquity; he appears to have preached the simple life later advocated by the\\nCynics, and to have been put to death for an attempt to introduce a Greek religious ritual into his\\ncountry, Scythia (in what is now Southern Russia), 171–2.\\nAnacreon, a Greek lyric poet born c. 570 B.C., 159.\\nAncus (Ancus Martius), early Roman king, traditionally 642–617 B.C., 210.\\nAntony, Mark, colleague of Julius Caesar, later ally of Cleopatra, defeated by Octavian\\n(Augustus) at Actium in 31 B.C., 144.\\nAppius (Appius Claudius Caecus), Roman statesman, orator and first prose writer (fl. c.\\n300 B.C.), 217.\\nArdea, a town in a low-lying, then malarial area of Italy not far from Rome, 182, 194.\\nAristotle, famous Greek philosopher (384–322 B.C.), tutor of Alexander the Great, of\\nimmense learning, author of standard works on many scientific subjects and on logic, ethics,\\npolitics and drama, 40, 119–21.\\nArruntius, Lucius, Augustan senator and historian, consul 22 B.C., 218–19.\\nAsellius, probably Asellins Sabinus, Augustan literary figure and teacher of rhetoric, 85.\\nAsia, 103, 180.\\nAthens, 186.\\nAttalus, a Stoic philosopher whose lectures Seneca attended, 49, 115, 201, 204, 207.\\nAugustus, formerly called Octavian (63 B.C.-A.D. 14), under whom Rome changed from\\na republic into a principate, 142, 214.\\nBaba, a clown, 62.\\nBaiae, a fashionable spa on the Bay of Naples, 107–8.\\nBucillus, unknown, 148.\\nButa, Acilius, wealthy Roman, 223–4.\\nCaesar, Julius, renowned Roman general and statesman, assassinated in 44 B.C., 193–4.\\nCaligula, the cruel emperor Gaius, A.D. 37–41, 129–30.\\nCallistus, a former slave who had become a kind of secretary of state, dealing with\\n\\n\\x0cpetitions addressed to the emperor Claudius by private individuals, 92–3.\\nCambyses, King of Persia and its empire 529–521 B.C., conqueror of Egypt, 144.\\nCampania, district of Italy around the modern Naples, 108, 142.\\nCapri, 125.\\nCato (Marcus Porcius Cato), Roman statesman and stern moral figure, in his own\\nlifetime (95–46 B.C.) and centuries following celebrated for his unbending principles; an\\nopponent of Caesar and after civil war broke out a follower of Pompey; famous suicide after\\ndefeat of Pompeians at Thapsus (in what is now Tunisia); looked back on by later Romans as a\\nchampion of the republic, freedom and (like his famous great-grandfather who bore the same\\nname) the old Roman morality (cf.
